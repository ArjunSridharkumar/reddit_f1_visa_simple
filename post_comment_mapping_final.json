    " EAD card returned to USCIS by post office\nBody of the post: Hey guys, I would greatly appreciate some help? So my original plan was for my friend to receive my\nEAD card from the US and ship it abroad to where I am. However, USPS just told me a few hours ago via their tracking\nsystem that my mail was returned to the sender because they could not verify the addressee. I checked USCIS page\nand they say the same thing (that the package is being returned). My flight was scheduled this Tuesday Aug 20 and if\nthings had gone according to plan, I would have received my card by Tuesday afternoon latest. Now I don?t know what\nto do.\nI don?t know why USPS returned the package. I tried contacting them but their automated customer service is not\nhelpful during weekends. My friend is not home so they can?t check whether the USPS driver just scanned the wrong\nstatus. If it does actually get returned to USCIS, I don?t know how long it?ll take for me to get it back. Which means I\ndon?t know what date to extend my flight.\nWould I be allowed entry to the US without a physical EAD card? I saw some say that a receipt could help and it?s up to\nthe discretion of the officer. What do you guys recommend I do? I apologize for the lengthy post but I am so anxious\nright now and in need of advice ?\n": [

        "This was me in 2023. Graduated 2022 Nov. found job in Aug2023. My room mates were visiting home\ncountry and I was alone. Can fairly say I was suffering from depression. I used to wake up late, not have breakfast. Get\nfresh and talk to parents and just stand by the window watching people go about their days. I used to apply actively a\ncouple days and then Im tired to even do anything for a few minutes. Good thing was I was getting 1 interview every 3\nweeks for 50-80 applications and Ik you need atleast 10 interviews before you will land a job ( these numbers dont\nmatter now since people barely get interviews now). One application clicked and it was a part time role in a remote\nlocation that no one wanted to drive. I think I simply got lucky coz the company didnt have an HR and the person who\nspoke to me did not have any idea what I was speaking. The interviewer was a physician again who barely had any idea\nabout the role. I was an ex physician too and maybe that was the connection (the role is IT related). I didnt get the role\nuntil I called the office 70 days later to ask for updates. This is how dis organized the company was. Ihv been working\nhere for over a year now. Things have been streamlined by me and we are tracking stuff that we never did. I got my h1b\nand gc in procees. Things changed immediately.

Fast forward 2 months later and i get\nadmitted to a different school with a better program, so i contacted my DSO Last week to initiate the Transfer process.\nThen i get an email from her that My sevis record shows two things, once is Active but it has OPT PENDING, and the\nsecond is Initial I-20 for change of level, so it looks like there was a miscommunication between SEVP and USCIS, since\nmy application was already rejected while i was in grace period and enrolled into new program while also still in grace\nperiod, so now my DSO initiated a help ticket to Cancel the new initial I-20 for change of level and then bring back the\nrecord to active for the old one since the OPT was already rejected. \nThe only thing I'm afraid of is that my status looks like it's in a limbo, i did everything correctly and I'm face with this\nproblem. When i called SEVP they told me this is an easy fix just tell your DSO to do a correction, but my DSO did a\nhelp ticket and after 2 days SEVP requested more information such as transcripts and acceptance letter, etc.. she just\nsent them today, now I'm waiting  for the results, I'm really freaking out here, i can't sleep !!!!\nAny advice would be much appreciated !!\n": [

This gave me a good feeling that they are okay with\nmy temporary work status.\nI would love to be sponsored, but I can also enroll in a distance learning program (cough cough Day 1 CPT) after my\nEAD expires so at least I can give myself three years in the States. I think getting a job and artificially increasing my\nwork authorisation in the ways I think I might have to do to, is my redemption after I knew I was coming to the US with a\nReddit Posts\nton of regrets, but it was too late. It?s also about manipulating my odds and circumstances so I don?t feel inferior to\nSTEM students who clearly chose better than I did. Maybe it?s my way of giving myself a fair chance and an increased\nduration of visa just like STEM students. \nYes, I was very naive in choosing a non-STEM program, and only after coming here did I realize what a big mistake it\nwas.\nSorry for rambling. My main worry is about this job slipping away due to my visa status. I?m so scared to bring it up and\ndon?t want to. I?ve been turned away from so many jobs because of being an international student that I chose\nself-preservation and hid this detail.\nSo, do you think it?s a good sign that HR asked for the extra information regarding Cap-Gap? Will my I-9 be cleared?\nWhen can I finally relax? I guess I?ve been worried about losing this job before it even starts.\nMaybe HR doesn?t fully understand what this means, maybe they do. I don?t know. Maybe she?s just trying to fill out\nthe form since she said she needs this information to process my I-9.\nFYI: If the company decides to sponsor me and my H-1B gets picked, I will be eligible for Cap Gap \n": [

        "They can o ly ask if you are authorized to work in the US and then if you will require sponsorship. It's a\nfine line for HR since unless you answer YES to the 2nd question, they legally can't ask anything more. Employers are\nReddit Posts\nrequired to ensure that the candidate is able to work, which brings about the I-9 verification. But they are also prohibited\nfrom asking additional information based on discrimination laws. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure you have\nproper immigration status for work. As for the Day1 CPT, understand that it's very risky. The government has been\ncracking down on these a lot lately. If you are caught, you risk losing your legal status, deportation and a ban from the\nUS of up to  years. While I understand what you're going through,  please make sure you consider everything thoroughly\nbefore acting on it. Ah, one last option - if you are able to work for them at least a little while and they have a Blanket-L\nregistration, ask if they are willing to sponsor it for you. this does require you to work a minimum of 1 year for one the\ncompany's braches abroad, but if your position qualifies for it, it is a good learning path and a good way to return to the\nUS without having to deal with the H1B lottery.

It is 100% your responsibility to ensure the submitted\napplication is correct and complete, and it takes time for them to review and realize your STEM OPT recommendation is\nmissing.\n3.

        "Not working during your studies will not negatively affect your student visa status or academic\nstanding, as working up to 20 hours per week is an option, not a requirement. However, there are some considerations:\n1. **Financial Implications**: If you were relying on the income from part-time work to cover living expenses, not working\ncould impact your budget. You may need to find other financial resources to cover your costs.\n2. **Practical Experience**: Working, even part-time, can provide valuable experience related to your field of study,\nwhich could be beneficial for your resume and future job prospects. However, if you feel that your academic workload is\ntoo heavy or you want to focus entirely on your studies, it?s perfectly fine to prioritize that.\n3. **Scholarships or Funding Requirements**: If you have any scholarships or funding that requires you to work a certain\nnumber of hours (e.g., a research assistantship), not fulfilling those requirements could affect your funding.\n4. **Networking Opportunities**: Part-time jobs, especially on-campus, can be good for networking with professors, staff,\nand other students. If you decide not to work, you might miss out on some of these opportunities, but you can still\nnetwork in other ways.\nUltimately, the decision to work or not should align with your academic goals, financial needs, and personal well-being.\n"

    " Working under the F1 visa\nBody of the post: Hey, I'm from Brazil looking to apply to an US college and before committing to it, I have some\nquestions regarding the F1. I've been with multiple agencies and they gave me conflicting information.\nFirst agency I went to told me that with the visa I could work anywhere inside the college campus and get paid, but the\nsecond agency I went to told me that even though I was allowed to work in campus, I could not legally receive any\npaychecks, and now I'm just confused on who's right or wrong.\nAnother question, I've been told that if graduate in the STEM field you can apply to stay in the US for up to 3 years, so in\ntheory could I get an associates (2 years) then apply to stay 3 years (5 years total) and then apply for a bachelors\n(another 2 years) and once I graduate apply to stay another 3 years again for a total of 10 years in the US? It seems\nsketchy and it felt like the agency was trying to sell me a false dream but I'd love to know beforehand.\n": [
        "F-1 visa allows you work on campus for 20 hours during spring and fall semesters and 40 during\nsummer semester without needing to apply for any other applications. \nYou are allowed to work part time (20 hours) off campus in a company that aligns with your field of study, which this will\nrequire you to file CPT for. \nYou will need to have a Bachelors Degree to apply for OPT and being in a STEM field will allow you to have additional 2\nyear extension of OPT. \nYou cannot repeat OPT by getting another Bachelors, you only get OPT opportunity for each of the level of education.\nHope this helps !\n- ",
        "Yes you can work ON campus , no more than 20 hours a week and receive a paycheck. Saying you\ncan't be paid is nonsense.\nSTEM OPT is only for bachelors or higher. You can do 1 year of OPT after associates degree but you have to work, you\nhave 90 unemployment days and if you use them up you have to leave or do another academic program. They likely\nexplained getting a job OPT seem a lot easier than it actually is.\nYou get 1 chance at OPT per degree level , asscoiates , bachelors , masters etc\nWhile applying for OPT is simple, if you can't get a job then it goes to waste.

    " F1 Husband in Early Mid-life Crisis \nBody of the post: Hey everyone,\nThis is my first time posting anything on Reddit, and I could really use some support or advice.\nI?ve been living in the US on an F1 visa, and my wife and I have been renting an apartment together. Recently, my\nworld was turned upside down when I discovered that my wife had been cheating on me. She even brought the other\nman into our apartment to stay, without my knowledge, on the property for which I am still paying rent and living (I mean,\ncome on). \nThis betrayal has left me with no choice but to proceed with a divorce. Despite my efforts to save the marriage and\nexplore all potential possibilities, it's clear that I need to move on. To make matters worse, this situation has put a hard\npause on my Permanent Residency (PR) application. My wife is still willing to support the PR process, but after\nconsulting with an attorney, he suggested that it is no longer an option.\nReddit Posts\nWhat's most painful is that she has brought this up with no remorse and has simply moved on with her life, having this\nman stay at our apartment. I have a job that requires me to work a lot of hours, but I still work from home and do all the\nchores and care. Despite all my efforts, all our dreams and plans now mean nothing to her anymore. Her family is also\nshocked by her actions. For the record, she has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).\nGiven these personal circumstances, I need to take a break to focus on my mental health and deal with the divorce. I've\ngiven my two-week notice at work, which means I?ll be without a job soon. Since my F1 visa is tied to my student status\nand job, I?ll likely have to leave the US once it expires at the end of 2025.\nIt feels like the system is penalizing me. My wife?s actions have not only shattered my personal life but also jeopardized\nmy future in the US. I?ve done everything I can to support us, paying 98% of the bills while she?s been unable to find a\nfull-time job that contributes significantly. Now, I'm left with no choice but to close our shared bank account and figure\nout my next steps.\nIf anyone has been through something similar or has any suggestions on navigating this situation, I?d really appreciate\nit. Feeling pretty cooked right now and could use some guidance on how to move forward.\nReddit Posts\nThanks for listening.\n": [

Many people I know who receive green cards is by marrying a citizen or green card holder. \nH1B only give you up to 6 years to work in US. If you cannot obtain green card after that, sorry you must leave.\nAlso, your employer needs to sponsor you for H1B. Tbh, most employers will directly reject or ghost you once they know\nyou need this. That?s my experience and you can see plenty of f1 students complain here.

        "OP, based on your post and relies; it seems you are interested in the F1->GC path.\nReddit Posts\nHere?s my knowledge based on hearing experiences from other people.\nWhen you apply for a GC, you apply under a category. Most GCs are *sponsored*, which means that\nsomeone/something has to back you up in the process. When people marry a U.S. citizen, their partner is the sponsor\n(usually) and this counts as family sponsored visa. \nNow, a lot of people get sponsored a GC through an employer. A lot of employers don?t sponsor directly F1->GC, they\ntend to use an intermediary visa category. Options of intermediary visa categories are H1B and L1B. Each of them have\ntheir processes of obtaining them. You might wonder, why do they need the intermediary step? \nMany employer sponsored GC categories like EB2 and EB3, have a more than 3 year timeline. If you are a F1 student,\nthe maximum number of years you can have working for an employer is 3 years. For some employers, this timeline\nmakes them uncomfortable because it is really likely you will not finish the process before you have to leave the US. \nAnother argument is that as soon as your employer starts the GC process, you are showing immigrant intent. If you\ndon?t finish the GC timeline, you will have to leave the US or apply for another US visa and having a GC application\nstarted while you were an F1 student, does not look good in the eyes of immigration. Remember, a F1 visa a\nnonimmigrant visa. As a result, it is preferred to be in a dual-intent visa category, like H1B to start the application\nprocess.\nNow, as I said, H1B is one of those intermediary visa categories. How do you get an H1B visa? Well, your employer\nputs your name in an application pool. In theory, there are 2 pools: the postgraduate pool (P1) and the rest (P2). During\nthe lottery, 20K applications get selected from P1. Applications from P1 not selected, get combined with P2 and 65K\napplications get selected. In total, every year, regardless of number of applications, 85K H1B spots are available.\nReddit Posts\nEach year, the chances of getting your application selected depends on how many applicants have applied that year.\nThe number of applicants have increased every year, and it is not expected to decrease. Each year the probability is\ndifferent, and you can approximate it by doing 85K/# of valid applications. You can go and Google how many\napplications/applicants were each year. It used to be roughy 25% chance. Some years (I believe 2021 & 2022), it\ndropped to something like 12%. Now, with some math of probability, you can calculate the expected value of getting\nyour application selected at least once in N attempts to be N*P, where P is the probability. STEM students get 3-4\nattempts.\nAll of this to say, there?s no guarantees. Yes, the probability of getting a GC after F1 through an employed is non 0%.\nBut it is not 100%. It always falls something in between. It is up to you to decide whether or not that risk/chance is\nsomething you want to attempt and make life decisions based on.\n"

    " How hard is it to get h1b or stay in the US after graduation?\nBody of the post: How hard is to get h1-b after F1 visa?\nHello, guys.\nI am looking for studying in the US and I came across the difficult to stay in the country after finishing university by many\nstudents searching about the topic.\nI know that the h1b is lottery based but I would like to know if the country you?re from interfere in the process or the\nmajor you graduated. In the case I am from Brazil and am interested in the STEM field, which I know you can extend\nyour OPT.\nThe H1b visa is the only option if you want to stay there besides doing graduation or masters, phd? Or is there\nsomething else? \nI really appreciate your help and sharing your experience.\n": [
        "Honestly it is much harder to get the job than to WIN the lottery. To put in perspective, you will do twice\nor more effort just to get a job willing to sponsor you and once you find one(if you do) there is a huge chance that you\nwont get the visa. I was employed by a company willing to sponsor. %70 of the employees were students and people\nkeeping their student status through master programs. Several years of them participating on the lottery and not get it.\nThe turnover was high not because of the company beings cutthroat but because people had to go back to their\ncountries.\nI don?t mention this to discourage you but sadly I was naive to not know until I experienced it firsthand. I am still on the\ngrind and looking for a way to stay.\nReddit Posts\nMost companies wont hire you because it?s not viable to hire someone with no experience and pay for all the costs of\nH1B. If possible I would research any american companies in your country. Come to study and do internships and use\nyour OPT on said company. If they are willing to sponsor after college, great, if not go back and work for them and\ncontinue applying to that company for a position in the U.S with you having more experience and being familiar with the\nindustry there?s a chance they are willing to bring you back.\nI only know of one person that did this and worked, take it with a grain of salt.\n- ",
        "H1b is a 1:5 ratio or about a 20% chance which is low as hell and that comes down to America being\nthe dumbest country in ever seen, I mean besides them who the hell does lottery to work visas. Anyways your main\nproblem is getting a job in the first place as most employers are not a fan of sponsorships even after 3 years, so you\nhave to be actively searching and networking. \nGood luck\n- ",

    " Need help with my F1 interview\nBody of the post: Hi, I'm a prospective master's student. I was initially admitted to Spring 2024, and I got my US F1 Visa.\nI went to the US around December 15, 2023. When I went to the US, I felt homesick and decided to go back to Pakistan\nafter two weeks. One of the reasons I took this decision was that I had the option to defer, which I did to Fall 2024. I\nthought to myself, \"I can go back now and come back if I feel like it.\" Now I want to try again. As per the visa policy, I\nagain applied for an F1 visa. I have an interview on August 5th. I don't know what to say to them. Possible explanations: \n* Tell the truth that I felt homesick and came back, but the person will ask, \"Would you feel homesick again? How will\nthis time be any different?\" (Keep in mind, I'm applying through the Islamabad embassy in Pakistan, and it's the worst\nUS embassy) \nReddit Posts\n* Go with the first point but add that I have been to therapy, etc., even though I didn't, to answer the \"what's different this\ntime\" question. \n* Make up a medical family emergency, e.g., something happened to a family member; it was the first time something\nhappened, and I had an option to defer, so I did. Now everything is back to normal, and I want to go back (I think this is\nthe most safe option). \nWhat should I do?\nUpdate: Went with the truth. Got the visa. \n": [

    " F-1 Visa Applicant - Community College in California\nBody of the post: I need help regarding if I am likely to get rejected or accepted for my F-1 US Visa during the interview.\nHere's my situation:\nI am going to community college because I really didn't have an option to go anywhere else as I wasn't allowed to apply\nto universities till June due to my parents not allowing me to. They didn't want to send me to any universities and wanted\nme to join their businesses from the get-go. I ended up convincing them but it was a bit late so I really didn't have much\noption in where I should apply. After doing a bunch of research, I realized that going to a community college and\ntransferring to a 4-year university is the best option financially but also in terms of where I end up getting my degree\nfrom, as it is basically a second chance in helping me go to universities I probably wouldn't have been able to if I had\napplied to them as a high school senior.\nReddit Posts\nI chose a community college in California due to the amazing transfer program that they provide alongside its huge\ntransfer alumni network, of which I have already have been in contact with for a bit and they all recommended me to\nattend the community college I ended up choosing. Also the articulation agreements with all the CSU and UC schools\nand also USC are a huge factor to ensure that my courses and credits transfer without any hiccups.\nAdditionally, I chose to go to a Community College near the LA area as I also want to be able to visit the UCLA and USC\ncampuses as I will be applying to those as a transfer applicant. I can also simply book a flight and also go tour the\nStanford and UC Berkley campuses with the privilege of being able to go to a community college in California, especially\nnear the LA area.\nAnother reason is that I applied to a 4 year university aside from the community college in California and its not ranked\nhigh at all but it's close to my city. It is also far more expensive and it really isn't prestigious at all. I'd much rather go to\ncommunity college for 2 years and transfer than attend that university for 4 years and not only graduate from\nsomewhere mid but waste a ton of money.\nAnother reason is that I would much rather have a more intimate, 1 on 1, and classroom type environment for my\nclasses to further ensure my success than to attend a lecture hall at the university close to my city.\nThese are basically the main reasons as to why I want to go to Community College in California. Aside from that I also\nwant to participate in the student government and the athletics program there, which are not offered at the other\nuniversity that is close to my house.\nAfter I'm done with my bachelor's I plan to immediately come back to my country of residence as I have nothing else to\ndo in the United States other than to study, I have strong ties back home with all the businesses my family runs, and\nReddit Posts\neven my extended family living there and being involved in our business. I am basically required to take over the\nbusiness sooner or later so I have no plans of having a prolonged stay.\n": [

I am moving from the west coat to the east so I also am\nshipping my car and the shipping company needs the destination address which I don't have because I don't have my\nEAD yet so the company cannot work out accommodation for me.

Be super up front about ur\nsituation from the very beginning- u don?t want to get an offer only for them to rescind it because of OPT. It happens\nand it would be devastating. Also ask if they have an e-verify number. Some employers are open to hiring F1 students\nbut don?t have E-Verify numbers. Staffing agencies are tricky.

I?m planning to use my old f1 visa, which is still valid for two years, with a\nnew i20 to enter the country. I?m just wondering if I need to pay the sevis in this case.\n": [

        "Your old SEVIS number should no longer be valid because you graduated and a SEVIS transfer did\nnot happen. Your new i-20 will have another SEVIS number, and this number must match the one on your visa when\nyou enter the states. Hence, you can't use this new i-20 to enter on the old visa because the SEVIS numbers won't\nmatch. So basically you need to apply for a new F1 visa and pay the fee again.\nSource: me. I did summer school at one college during high school and then did undergrad a year later. I didn't know I\nneeded to pay the sevis fee again because I didn't know a new SEVIS number was needed, so I went to the embassy\nwith the undergrad i-20 and the old SEVIS number for the summer school (which was the SEVIS number on the old F1\nvisa that was valid for 5 years lol). Was rejected at the gate of the embassy for not matching SEVIS numbers, did not\neven make it past security. So yea, it doesn't matter whether your old F1 visa is still valid or not.

        "Don?t go the United States because it?s your last option. Don?t go to a random US university. Don?t\ngo to a university that is not in a good location. Don?t go to a university that is making you pay exorbitant fees for a\ndegree. Don?t go to US with the assumption that the loan will get paid off because ?i will get a job?. Arizona State, UT\nDallas etc are just money making machines. The job market is only bad for the students at average and below average\nuniversities. International students come here thinking if they just get good grades in their classes they will be fine which\nis absolutely not true. As OP said you need stellar projects to get through. You also need many other things like\nresearch contributions, projects that are funded etc that set you apart if you?re not from top universities which i?m\nassuming is most people on this sub. \nInternational students are still being hired who graduate from top tier institutions like CMU, UW, UIUC, UT Austin etc. \nMost people come here to work part time at a gas station or a motel and waste their time. If you want to come here to do\nmeager jobs and expect to succeed in tech, that?s not gonna happen. You?ll succeed wherever you put most of your\nefforts. Considering you?re doing part-time jobs as full time you might get yourself a promotion at your gas station, but\nReddit Posts\nnot a job in tech. The resume isn?t gonna build itself. Cheating in interviews might get you the job, but you can?t cheat\non the job. Cheers\nEdit: AI won?t take your job. AI will only take jobs that are repetitive and require no use of your brain (customer support).\nSWE is far away from being threatened by AI.\nE2: CMU - Carnegie Mellon University, UW - University of Washington, UIUC - University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign. \nAlso, the best way to research about universities for me has been connecting with students who are already there in the\nexact program you?re aiming for. Be genuine when asking for help and be polite. Most won?t reply, but one will. I say\nthis with experience.\n- ",
        "While the post provides some insights, this is an oversimplification. Good grades account for some\nmerit in getting a job but that's not a priority. Don't spend too much time studying. \nPlease mind that my advise is more biased towards Comp Science majors.\nThe best way to leverage a Master's degree is to try to get an internship. Granted, finding one is quite difficult during\nthese times. But, if you manage to score one, you might be able to transfer that into a full time offer after you graduate.\nEven if it that doesn't happen, having an internship experience at a US company provides a substantial boost to your\nresume. The summer break is the best for this. Also check if your school offers co-op opportunities. And in many\noccasions you get a substantially better paycheck for the internship.\nAlso, network alot! For example, if you have an interest in Cybersecurity, join the club. Talk to the professors in a subject\nthat you're interested in and see if you can get in on a project. Or offer help. These experiences can really help you and\nReddit Posts\nalso build a good network of friends/professors that might be able to provide you with referrals.\nHaving a portfolio of projects helps a lot too (especially when applying for startups and smaller sized companies).\nLeverage hackathons and open source projects. \nAlthough I listed a few things, it'll be impossible to do all these things at the same time. So pick your flavor. Also, mixing\nthings up like this will really help you manage stress and stay consistent.\nI agree with OP on the fact that it's not very realistic to think that you could fund your whole education career with\npart-time work/in campus  work. However, the type of school you pick can make a big difference. Masters programs\ngenerally tend to be big money makers for schools. However, public research universities do tend to offer some tuition\nwaivers if you can score a teaching assistant position or a research assistant position. Instead of trying to get a loan for\n2 years (especially if it's high interest), I'd advise to get a loan for 1 year and see what you can leverage. Having said\nthat, not having the constant thought of figuring out funding will save you a lot of stress and help you stay focused.\nAnyways, wish y'all the best!\n- ",

    " I am regretting coming to the US\nBody of the post: [EDIT2: I GOT A JOB! All the hard work, the sleepless nights and the early mornings, finally paid off.\nI'm going to say that atleast 50% of this offer was luck. I didn't apply, nor did I get a referral. I started out sending cold\nemails. And one of them hit the mark. Met in person. Proved that I am capable. Sent me a take home open ended\nquestion which I answered better than he expected. Didn't bother whining over the take home. Just get shit done. Then\nhad a live coding round too, which actually turned out easier than expected. I did it. Got the offer even before ending the\ncall. I was quite literally having anxiety jitters by the end of it. But I did it. I'm proud of myself. Over the last 2 days, I feel\nless burdened than ever. I feel like I'm back to being that amazing person I was a year ago. \nBut my advice still stands. Especially for Indians. There are so many opportunities in India now. Coming to the US is a\nmentally draining experience. As soon as you land, you are stressed about internships. Then you are stressed about\nOPT and 90 days. Next comes the literal luck factor of getting an H1B. Not on merit. You get 3 tries to get it in a lottery.\nOnce you get a H1B then you're stressed about being laid off because your employer can literally kick you from the\ncountry. And if you're one of those people who wants a green card, good luck waiting for 50 years I guess. Idk the exact\nstats because I'm not even going to bother. I'm not getting an H1B. I'm doing my OPT, breaking even with my education\ncost and going home. I did what I set out to do, but I don't want to be living like a 2nd class citizen all my life just\nbecause I came from somewhere else. \nGo home, or better yet, don't come. There are a million ways to make money in India. You don't need a foreign degree. \nOne thing that makes sense here is doing a FULLY or ATLEAST PARTIALLY FUNDED program like an MS or PHD.\nPlease don't spend 60lakhs of loan to do this. If you have that much money invest it somewhere in India. \nIf you are crazy about getting a world class education just keep in mind that you are going to face the toughest time in\nyour life. Again, scholarships will decide your mental burden. Please get as many of them as possible. \nReddit Posts\nIf you have a lot of money to spare, go for it. The experience is like no other. \nAlso, if you want to become an entrepreneur US is the best place to be. High risk = high reward.\nThat's all folks! Good luck]\n[EDIT1: I did not expect this to blow up to this scale. Thank you for all the inputs. I'm truly grateful and will read through\nall the comments. It looks like we are in this together and there is no other way apart from going through and going\nforward. We got this ?]\nThis is a rant from a throwaway. I am super stressed out and panicking even though I'm graduating in May 2024.\nI'll be completing my m.eng in computer engineering from a highly reputed ivy league school. This has been one of the\nhardest or lowest points in my life. I have faced a lot of trouble growing up, but this is a different kind of beast that is\ntaking a toll on my mental health. \nI'm applying to analytics/data related roles since my program started in August. And I've landed a grand total of 1\ninterviews, and that company also ghosted me after 4 rounds. I think what's holding me back is the \"do you need\nsponsorship\" question. I never wanted to live there on H1B. I only want to work on OPT and go back home. And I STILL\nCANNOT FIND EMPLOYMENT. \nI've applied to 250 roles, and networked with more than 100 people so far. I don't know if this number is too small, but at\nReddit Posts\nthis point I'm going to intentionally slow down. Trying to put quality over quantity.\nI am not the smartest person out there, but neither am I so bad that I cannot be employed. It feels like the entire F1\nsystem is just out to own you. You are so dependent on your job, just to be allowed to exist in the damn country. And the\ncountry is not even that good. It took my dumbass a long time to figure out that my happiness comes from the people\naround me, and when I'm in the US I'm permanently feeling homesick.\nMy parents are ok with me coming back and are also scared seeing me this stressed. They often call me to make sure\nI'm mentally okay, which I am not but have to lie about. I luckily had scholarships and no need for a loan. But if I don't\naccomplish this, I will feel like I let myself down. I have failed a lot but this feels like a HUGE let down, on another level.\nAnd I don't even understand why it feels so, when I know that I will be much happier back home. \nShame & societal pressure are playing on my mind. Have I gone nuts?\n": [

Do a few iterations with ChatGPT, your friends and seniors\nworking at companies and stick to it. If you ask 10 different people, they will give you 10 different directions to change,\nbecause if you ask them, they feel like they have to give you some feedback and it start a loop of pointless A/B changes.\n7.

Calmly do what you got to do\nReddit Posts\nregardless of the outcome?that?s the mindset one should slowly learn to cultivate. I am learning as well. \nThe job market sucks more than it has ever been. That?s a fact. You would have had a relatively easier time getting a\ngood job 10 to 15 years ago. And I know some people might say ?but there are people who can get a good job my age\ndespite the job market being this way? but that?s THEM and NOT YOU. The reality of life if we all varies in terms of\nability, personality, luck and the environment we were raised in. If everyone gets everything they want in life then that?s\njust absurd. \nThink about what you can do NOW. And do it regardless of the outcome. You have a supportive parents. I would kill to\nhave them. I see my friends crying over not getting interviews and worry more than they should have when their parents\nare willing to support them no matter what.

Any wrong move in the US adds debt to your account. Seriously, don?t torture yourself by staying here.\nI grew up laughably poor in a high crime area of SoCal and fended for myself after high school. Managed to get good\ngrades and got a full ride to a reputable college on the west coast, eventually getting my masters from another well\nknown east coast school. Now I have a stable and lucrative career in fintech. It took achieving the ?American Dream? to\nrealize it was a hoax. Realistically our country is held hostage by an unforgiving free market ?dog eat dog? mentality\nthat fosters no sense of inclusion or community.\nEven after you land your job, you?ll have to fight to keep it, and then do the process all over again when you apply for\nanother company, and there are no employee protections. \nI?ve lived in other parts of the world and I can tell you that the happiest people are the ones with the strongest\ncommunities. People need people, America teaches you to be distrustful and woefully independent. In the next few\nyears I?ll be moving out of this country, I?d suggest you do the same if you value connection and relationships over\nfalse promises of material gain. Good luck to you.\n- ",

        "A few things I did when I graduated and was searching for my first job on OPT:\n1. Offer to volunteer at one of the research labs at CS  department of your university. I?m sure there might be a of\nresearch labs at your university since you graduated from an Ivy League university. Volunteer only if they are providing a\nvolunteering letter. Submit it to your DSO. This should be stop your OPT counter of days without unemployment. This\nshould take a lot of stress off your back so that you can apply for jobs.\nIf you have a good rapport with the lab professor and he/she have enough funding they can also offer you some RA\nposition which is a great start IMO.\n2. In the current job market applying for 250 jobs is not enough. Aggressively apply for atleast 1000-2000 positions. I?m\nsure with your education background should be able to land a job at some startup as well. Average wait time to find a\njob is 4+ months. Drop your resume to recruiters on LinkedIn.\n3.

Every morning wake up, go on LinkedIn search, look for data companies (or any other relevant\nindustry), set location to your dream locations, and start sending connection requests. Test between short notes, longer\nnotes, and no notes where you send a message after. Generally being transparent here and saying you like what they\ndo and you?re looking for a job is better. Try to get on a call learn more about the company, ask for relevant roles the\nteam is looking at, other companies if the one you?re talking to is not too relevant. You?ll start seeing a lot more\nopportunities. \nBut again, don?t just stay here for a 5/10 when you can go back to where you might feel better with a 8/10 job. \nDM me if you have any specific questions\nReddit Posts\n- ",

        "I was in the same exact place as you after graduating from my masters. I struggled and finally landed a\njob 10 months after I graduated. Those 10 months were hell and each morning I woke up, I felt like shit and was\ncontemplating extreme things I wanted to do. I still kept at it due to the same reasons you have, loan repayment. But\nafter I landed the first job, things changed a lot along with my mental health. 5 years later, and now I'm in a better place\n(still not the best due to dealing with H1B visa bs). But I think that if I had returned back, I would have missed all the\nexperiences that I had these past few years and I would have not tested my resilience. Things are not going to be\nperfect anywhere (US or your home country). Each place has its own struggles. You need to ask yourself where you\nwould have the best outcome. If staying with your family is your top priority then you should definitely go back. For me it\nwas not (due to several personal reasons) and I decided to stay back and fight. Screw society and what they think about\nyou. They'll say things for a few days and then switch to some other juicy topic. I have made certain decisions in my life\nwhich are not going to be looked at in a favorable way by \"society\" but it was right for me. What you need to definitely\nworry about is your job prospects in India. Sure it'll take a little longer for you to clear your loan when you're earning in\nrupees but that's not the end of the world.

        "I just came across this post, I never respond to anything on reddit, but I was in your shoes few years\nago so here is my perspective-\nFirstly, have a little fun while you?re still here. Yes, studying and applying jobs will take up most of your day, but don?t\nforget to live a little at the end of each day, I know you?re desperate but eventually everything works out. Lot of people\nin perfectly fine jobs are unhappy, so it is important to stay positive and have a healthy perspective.\nSecond advice is, do not keep scrolling on reddit or linkedin or blind. Don?t read those posts. Average people with\naverage jobs post very rarely about this topic. Also the algorithm learns what you?re doing so it keeps feeding you more\ndoom and gloom. Do some gym, meditation etc in your free time. \nThirdly, society doesn?t care. You do good or bad they don?t care. Everyone has their own problems to deal with. A lot\nof my friends went back to India because they couldn?t find a job. Fast forward few years they?re all thriving. In the\nmoment it is hard to see, but zoom out and you can see eventually everything works out.\nReddit Posts\nMy last advice is do not ignore the midwest. There are a lot of jobs and very few people apply comparatively to the east\nand west coast. There will be less competition and people are generally empathetic. Once you land something you can\nmove to your dream location once the market gets better.\n- ",

    " To all incoming students: Please Get a Bank loan for your entire Masters.\nBody of the post: I've seen far too many people coming here under the assumption that they can pay off their college\nReddit Posts\nfees on Part times Alone. This basically raises two problems:\n# 1. There are no part times for incoming students:\nI personally know several people who have graduated in 2021, who are still holding onto their part times, because of the\njob market right. \nIn fact I know probably three guys from the entire Fall 2023 batch in my college who have managed to secure part times.\nThe rest of the students are suffering immensely by living with 10 to 15 people in a 2 bed room apartment barely making\ntheir ends meet. \nObviously this is no way to live and you will never be able to focus on your studies.\n# 2. You will never get a job if you are working these low gigs all throughout your masters:\nI see a lot of people complaining about how the job market is extremely hard and they've apply for 100s of jobs everyday\nwithout a single interview call. There are multiple reasons for it, but one of the biggest reason I see is **lack of portfolio\nand projects** during your masters. \nSince Majority of Students come for MS CS. If you are working 40 hours per week on your part time you'll never be able\nto focus on learning new technologies, improving your DSA skills or get any certifications. \n# Here's What you should do instead:\n1. Spend a lot of time in the library. Library is your friend and this is where you are going to study and work during these\ntwo years in order to get a 6 figure job in the future.\n2. Be active on LinkedIn: It doesn't mean to keep posting \"interested\" under job posts. It means to write articles pertinent\nto your technology showcase projects from Github.\nReddit Posts\nRemember that right now it's probably one of the toughest job markets since 2008. It's only going to get harder as AI is\ngetting smarter and smarter everyday.\nIt's even hard for US Citizens to get tech roles right now. So YOU NEED TO EXCEL AT WHAT YOU DO IN ORDER\nFOR THE COMPANY TO CHOSE YOU OVER A USC.\nDon't make the mistakes I did and please for the love of god FOCUS ON YOUR CAREER EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n": [

Don?t go to a university that is making you pay exorbitant fees for a\ndegree. Don?t go to US with the assumption that the loan will get paid off because ?i will get a job?. Arizona State, UT\nDallas etc are just money making machines. The job market is only bad for the students at average and below average\nuniversities.

If you want to come here to do\nReddit Posts\nmeager jobs and expect to succeed in tech, that?s not gonna happen. You?ll succeed wherever you put most of your\nefforts. Considering you?re doing part-time jobs as full time you might get yourself a promotion at your gas station, but\nnot a job in tech. The resume isn?t gonna build itself.

Be genuine when asking for help and be polite. Most won?t reply, but one will. I say\nthis with experience.\n- ",
        "While the post provides some insights, this is an oversimplification. Good grades account for some\nmerit in getting a job but that's not a priority. Don't spend too much time studying. \nPlease mind that my advise is more biased towards Comp Science majors.\nThe best way to leverage a Master's degree is to try to get an internship. Granted, finding one is quite difficult during\nthese times. But, if you manage to score one, you might be able to transfer that into a full time offer after you graduate.\nEven if it that doesn't happen, having an internship experience at a US company provides a substantial boost to your\nresume. The summer break is the best for this. Also check if your school offers co-op opportunities. And in many\noccasions you get a substantially better paycheck for the internship.\nReddit Posts\nAlso, network alot! For example, if you have an interest in Cybersecurity, join the club. Talk to the professors in a subject\nthat you're interested in and see if you can get in on a project. Or offer help. These experiences can really help you and\nalso build a good network of friends/professors that might be able to provide you with referrals.\nHaving a portfolio of projects helps a lot too (especially when applying for startups and smaller sized companies).\nLeverage hackathons and open source projects. \nAlthough I listed a few things, it'll be impossible to do all these things at the same time. So pick your flavor. Also, mixing\nthings up like this will really help you manage stress and stay consistent.\nI agree with OP on the fact that it's not very realistic to think that you could fund your whole education career with\npart-time work/in campus  work. However, the type of school you pick can make a big difference. Masters programs\ngenerally tend to be big money makers for schools. However, public research universities do tend to offer some tuition\nwaivers if you can score a teaching assistant position or a research assistant position. Instead of trying to get a loan for\n2 years (especially if it's high interest), I'd advise to get a loan for 1 year and see what you can leverage. Having said\nthat, not having the constant thought of figuring out funding will save you a lot of stress and help you stay focused.\nAnyways, wish y'all the best!\n- ",

    " STEM OPT Extension denied - my experience & advice for future applicants\nBody of the post: Sorry for the long post.\n- Early November 2023: applied for STEM OPT Extension. (EAD expiring mid December).\n- Late February 2024: STEM OPT Extension denied due to DSO not submitting recommendation into SEVIS at all. Even\nthough she said she did.\nSkippable backstory/explanation: I wanted to apply early October, but my DSO was extremely unresponsive. Not the\nfirst time either; back in June I needed her to write a letter to my employer stating my degree was eligible for STEM OPT\nExtension, which took her 2 weeks and 3 attempts to get right.\nI tried for a couple of weeks to get her to send me a new I-20 and put in my recommendation (clear in the emails). I gave\nup and asked for her availability to meet with her in person. I drove 3 hours roundtrip to meet with her. This was early\nNovember. I submitted my application 2 days later. \nIn our meeting she mentioned she had never done this before and wasn?t sure what to do. I should?ve seen this fucking\nmassive red flag, but I didn?t. 3 DSOs at my school and she was in charge of OPT matters, so I just assumed she was\ntrained and knew what to do. I was so wrong. She gave me my new I-20. I asked her to update my SEVIS employment\nrecords, and asked her if she put the recommendation for extension in, and she said yes. She did change my\nReddit Posts\nemployment records, so why would I have assumed she didn?t put the recommendation in? \nI get denied. I ask her about it. She then emails me saying she doesn?t have my I-983. This is the first time she ever\nmentions this form. I wasn?t even aware of this form. Why would I when she told me back in November that my\nrecommendation was submitted to SEVIS? Either way, it became clear to me that she didn?t know about that form\neither, as she never asked it from me in the whole hour we met and because, again, she said she put in my\nrecommendation in SEVIS. Not to mention she had months to figure out how to do her part in this process, but she\nnever bothered. My school also has a lot of the blame. International student services have always been almost\nnonexistent, so it?s not surprising DSOs aren?t trained at all, and they go through so many of them.\nClearly my school and DSO aren?t fit to deal with these matters. Untrained, incompetent, and dishonest. Sucks that I\nwas the one who had to find out the hard way. Keep in mind my employer would?ve gladly filled their part of I-983. My\ndegree being extension eligible was the condition for me to get hired. Could I have done some things differently? Yes. I\ngenuinely do think my school/DSO are to blame. They?re not responsible for me filling out the I-983 (btw the form only\ncomes up in the employer section of USCIS website), but they very much are responsible for doing the bare minimum:\nbeing trained in DSO matters, and being honest to people.\nUnfortunately, immigration matters in the US are extremely unforgiving. I knew this already, but the thing with STEM\nOPT Extension is that even though the application is very personal and considered optional, it?s very dependent on your\nschool/DSO. If it was just up to me, everything would?ve been ok. But sadly, it isn?t. \nWhat I recommend for future applicants:\n1) Apply day 1 (90 days before your initial OPT ends per your EAD). This will hopefully allow you to reapply if denied.\n2) Even if you can?t afford premium processing, do it. Open a credit card if you have to. Not worth risking a denial and\nnot being able to reapply. Unlike initial OPT, you?ll be losing your STEM OPT extension years for that education level. \nReddit Posts\n3) Never trust your DSO or school to do right by you. Confirm your new I-20 is right. Confirm recommendation was\nentered in SEVIS.\n4) Don?t plan life too ahead until your extension is approved.\n5) Don?t submit application until after recommendation is in.\nLawyer consults: I consulted an immigration and a civil litigation lawyer. I can sue for lost wages only. And I?d be at the\nmercy of the court/judge. There?s a case because there?s email evidence. But it?s still a foreigner vs a U.S. institution\ncase. Unclear if I?d need to be present in the US, but I?m out of status. Also, contingency is rare when suing universities\nso it would take $$$ and months of waiting.\nWhat?s next for me? I?m going to be honest, it?s an awful, massive setback for my life and career. My family is affected\ngreatly too. I don?t know where to go from here. I?m going back to a third world country where opportunities are\nextremely scarce. Unlike many international students, my family is not well off by any means.\nAsk any questions if you have them.\nNaming and shaming school: Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas.

    " Job search experience as an international student \nBody of the post: Hi everyone,\nReddit Posts\nI want to share my job search experience as an international during my time in school. So I?m on my third year of my\nOPT (STEM) and been working for a while now. Didn?t get H1B and planning to go home soon. I had a chance of\nthinking back about my struggles and how hard it was to look for a job. \nDuring my sophomore year, I started looking for internships, by attending career fairs. This was when my school career\nfairs didn?t really take international students into considerations. So most of the companies, did not look to hire\ninternational students. I had to go booth by booth explaining my situation where I required sponsorship. I remembered\nas soon as I mentioned that, their facial expressions changed. Suddenly, it became ?we have to get back with you on\nthat?, which obviously means I never heard back. My school was non top school, so most of the attending companies\nweren?t big companies that would hire international students at the time. \nIt was rough, but god damn I did put in work. I participated in many school events, volunteered, became school\nambassador, research project, worked as TA, got many scholarships, and did everything I could just to make sure I\nstood out. Of course I still have time for myself, a life, and friends etc. \nOne day I attended to one of the career fair and I remembered one of the recruiters told me that I would have an easier\ntime looking for a job as Jane Doe because of my name sounds nothing like an American. This was so fucked up and I\nremembered her till today. This killed my self-esteem where I wanted to change who I was, but I never stopped trying. \nEventually everything paid off. After 400 applications, 10 interviews, 3 offers for my internship, which led me to a full time\nposition today. There are many other things that happened, good and bad, but maybe for another time. I am proud of\nwhere I am and appreciated all the opportunities I got.\nReddit Posts\nI just wanted to share that I understand that some of you are having a hard time and it is ok to feel tired and desperate.\nNever stop trying until the end. You will never know how you will turn out unless you try. Don?t let people tell you\notherwise!\n": [

I could have continued that existing job on STEM OPT\nbut I wasn?t confident on my job profile and didnt want to suffer the H1B lottery fate. So I went back home to my home\ncountry. Took some time to relax and recuperate. Decided I should do grad school because the PhD stipend is actually\nmore than what I get paid at home lol. So I finished my PhD, got a job (it was way easier to get a job as an PhD intl\nstudent in the US), and now applying for EB2-NIW. My lawyers are very confident about my profile.

    " Stressed as hell.\nReddit Posts\nBody of the post: Just another post ranting about OPT and the lack of callbacks or responses to the 100's of job\napplications submitted over the last couple months.\nI'm graduating with a Masters' degree in Computer Science now, my OPT starts on Feb 10th (using the 60 day period),\nthen the 90 day countdown starts as well, and I haven't gotten at least one interview. I'm starting to question my decision\ncoming here to get this degree. \nI worked for 2 years after my undergrad as a software developer back home, and spent the next 2 years here, getting\nthis degree. I'm grateful for the experience and the personal growth I've gained, but this uncertainty is way too stressful. \nI've explored all my options, I've talked to my thesis advisor and she helped me make a list of PhD programs that I could\napply (for next Fall), but that's another 3-4 years of study!

It's been hard to feel happy about graduating\ntbh, I withdrew my name from commencement this semester in the hope of doing it in a happier time (with a job) at a\nlater semester.\nI know that there is still hope, but I'm struggling. I've had my resume reviewed, apart from minor nuances the feedback\nhas been generally good, except I haven't heard back from any prospective employers. Most of my past work\nexperience is with Angular and NestJS (a backend framework) and I hardly see any job postings for those skills. I've\nbeen transferring my skills over to React and SpringBoot gradually. Working on small projects and slowly building a\nportfolio to start applying for those positions.\nI also feel like I have a cool idea that I could work on as a small project/startup, but I don't see any opportunity to earn\nfrom it. Maybe I'll just end up working on it to put it on my resume. I'm open to any suggestions that'd help me endure\nthese stressful times.

    " Post-Completion OPT Application Timing Advice from an Elder: There is almost ne\nBody of the post: Background: I've been working with international students for over two decades. Recent changes in\ngroup decision making regarding OPT application timing among a large portion of students seems less than helpful to\ntheir own OPT applications. My experience and perspective on OPT goes beyond one or two application cycles. Here is\nmy personal advice when considering your OPT application timing options. \nPrior to 2023, most students completing study in May would have been lined up to get their OPT applications to USCIS\nin February. This was the trend for many, many years prior to 2023. Which was the smart thing to do.\nSuddenly in 2023, in some mass common decision that can only come from bad advice/information floating around on\nReddit or some Whatapp group, many students started choosing to delay their own OPT applications. And not only by a\nlittle bit, but changing years of practice of applying in February to instead largely applying in late March and in April.\nReddit Posts\nSome reasons to consider being well-prepared to make timely and early applicants for OPT with USCIS: \n1. USCIS processing time vary widely. The time it took for applicants who applied last week is very likely to be different\nthan the timeline of outcomes for those who apply next week. You cannot predict USCIS timelines. I cannot predict\nUSCIS timelines. Trying to do so is folly. The best way to protect yourself from that is get your application to them as\nearly as they allow. Then, you can sit back and relax instead of spending time stressing out about whether or not your\nOPT will be approved \"on time.\" USCIS OPT processing times over the last two decades have typically fallen\nsomewhere between two and four months. Sometimes they've been faster than that (lucky times!). Sometimes they've\ntaken longer than that. Three or four months is not a delay by USCIS; it's pretty standard.\n2. Things can and do go wrong with applications to USCIS. Your application could be missing something. Documents\nmay not upload appropriately. USCIS may look at your application and want to know more information and pause your\napplication while they send to you an RFE. Your OPT may get approved but then your EAD gets lost in the mail which\nusually take many weeks if not months sometimes to get replaced (and your employer won't let you start working until\nthey see your EAD as proof of employment authorization). Being well-prepared and applying early gives you more time\nto deal with those things if they happen. Delaying your own application means reducing your time to deal with such\nthings if they happen.\n3. You want to wait to ask your academic advisor and DSO for information/documents for OPT (such as the OPT I-20) at\nthe same time all of the continuing students want to also ask them for summer CPT and summer travel signatures?\nSounds like a great way to slow down your own application steps (as well as summer CPT requests for continuing\nstudents). Also, it seems likely USCIS might get busier around March and April with H-1B processing. \nAs noted, USCIS processing times are widely unpredictable. However, there was a very clear pattern both of the last\ntwo semesters (this is written in early March 2024). With student choices this year, it seems very likely the same will\nhappen again this semester.\nReddit Posts\n1. For May 2023 graduates, OPT applicants applying in February and very early March were getting OPT application\ndecisions back in anywhere from one to six weeks from application. Guess what? So far in 2024 the same thing is\nhappening.\n2. For May 2023 graduates, OPT applications submitted in late March and April took *months*, not weeks, for review.\nOften times taking between 3 and 4 months. Then there was much panic as students wanting to start working who\ndecided to delay their own OPT application timing resulted in them not getting their OPT approvals/EADs by the dates\nthey wanted to start working. A lost EAD in the mail? Something with plenty of time to fix when it is lost in March\nbecomes a huge problem when it was issued and lost in July and the student is already building days of OPT\nunemployment.\nThere was a very similar pattern for Fall 2023. Well-prepared students who applied in September and early October?\nFast OPT decisions. Those who delayed until late October, November, or December? Mostly taking months for OPT\napplication review by USCIS.\nWhoever started students choosing to delay their own applications by some Whatsapp or Reddit \"advising\" deserves a\nclass action lawsuit for spreading such bad advice. \nExcept for some very individual and unique situations, my advice is then apply early. My personal advice is that the best\nway to be best prepared as a May graduate is to have your OPT application to USCIS by February of that same year.\nDidn't get that done this year as a May graduate? Take steps now to get that submitted ASAP. Don't make a decision to\ndelay your own application; delaying is more likely going to create problems for you than taking timely action would. \n": [

        "it?s hard for people to find jobs give how bad the job market is recently. The job market was also bad\nin 00? and 08? but there weren?t so many international students back then. The only valid reason I can think of is that\nby applying closer to the end of grace period they are hoping that USCIS review their case later than the end of their\ngrace period and consequently give them a start date later than what originally could have been their latest start date.\nFor example  student?s grace period ends on 7/11, they apply on 7/10 and uscis review their case on 8/1. Under this\nscenario uscis may give them a start date of 8/1. Then they effectively prolonged their grace period by one month or so.\nHowever I think this is a very dangerous game to play, and I 100% agree with you. People shouldn?t rely on luck when it\ncomes to applying to OPT.\n- ",

        "Hey man! Sorry you?re going through that all. If I were you, i?d think about the following things. Take\neverything i say with a grain of salt since i just did undergrad and have been in the industry for 2 years.\n1. Find your niche based on your experiences and background and really just go after those roles like a mad man. I\nknow it is daunting to do that given that us internationals have slim chances so we often tend to cast a wider net.\nHowever, I had to suffer the downside of that because I spread myself too thin. Jack of all trades but master of none.\n2. Since you mentioned you graduated from a reputed college (so did I), it tends to make us feel very needy of only the\nmost reputable and highest paying roles. If you really drop that filter from your job search, you?ll find tones of\nopportunities that you can simply just apply for without minimal effort and you?re likely to hear back purely because\nReddit Posts\nthose roles get less applicants and, if they get someone with a masters with a brand name, they?ll immediately jump on\nit.\n3. This may be kind of obvious but it wasn?t for me until it was too late. Companies (especially in tech) couldn?t care\nless about your grades, major, or college. They want to see practical applications of your knowledge in projects and a\nstrong passion(even if you have to fake it). I got too stuck up with my grades and began tying my qualifications too\nclosely to the college i went to rather than my own personal capabilities. Sometimes tailoring your resume from that\nmindset helps getting attention from recruiters.\n4. VERY IMPORTANT. You are doing volunteer work which you can genuinely use to showcase that you are not in for\nthe money but for the work. Talk highly and proudly about it instead of making it sound like you weren?t competent\nenough to get paid for it. \n5. VERY VERY IMPORTANT. Not many of us internationals know this but non-profits can sponsor your H1B WITHOUT\nA FRICKIN LOTTERY. They can make a case for you (like a green card) for an H1B and you?ll get it garunteed. I have\nnot personally hunted for those opportunities but i know people who?ve done it. \n6. The US is not the end of the world. There?s plently of money and opportunity out there in different countries that yoh\nmay \nnot \nknow \nof. \nDo \nyou \nknow \nabout \nUK?s \nHPI \nvisa? \nSee \nif \nyour \ncollege \nis \non \nthe \nlist:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa\n6.

I know academia can feel suffocating at a point but a PhD is MADE FOR INTERNATIONALS.\nCitizens couldnt care less about it coz well.. they are citizens and they?re not on the H1B/F1 time bomb. They get into\nthe industry and make money so don?t really opt for it that much. Talk to professors and they?d be happy to take you in.\nReddit Posts\nOne of my closest friends, super talented, didn?t land a job but he went back home and reapplied for a PhD. \n7. Don?t overwhelm yourself with the thought that you?ll end up in a bad spot coz thats just wasting your time and\nmental energy. Wake up and just do what you think is best to get you a job. Genuinely just block your thoughts and take\naction (as cringy as that sounds). I was stuck in analysis paralysis for a solid year only to realize I was just holding\nmyself from giving it my best.

The last years, my\ninternship got rescinded since they found out I was an international students. During the interview process, I told them\nabout my situation, but once I got the offer and found out the start day, I asked them to move it a 1-2 later so I can use\nmy CPT - then a few days later I get the rescinding letter. This year, I got an internship that starts in May 25, my school\nends on June 17. I asked them to move it later but they said no. I tried using OPT, but they need me to work full time\nduring May - Sept. Why does this always happen to me and why is the F1 Visa employment so annoying \n": [

        "Hello, I am a bit late to reply to you but I will anyway. \nI am also an international student in the US. I am currently finishing up my associates degree in a community college,\nand I will be transferring to a university in the fall. \nI was in the same position as you (also in my second semester). I felt like what I was doing was not worth it, and\neverything seemed boring and meaningless. My family and friends in my home country kept telling me to stay strong,\nand I ended up taking a break from social media because of that. \nReddit Posts\nI had one American friend only. We never hung out or anything like that though. I was extremely lonely. \nI overthink a lot, but in a good way. One night, I thought about how I could leave this mental state. I ended up giving my\nschool counselor a shot, and I loved it. I ended up seeing them once every week for an hour where I would vent about\neverything. Counseling is great, however, I only went there to vent, I expected no real advices, but my counselor was\ngreat and she ended up giving me some really good advices that I will share with you. \n1- Apply for a job at your college: The only way you can work while studying is through your college. There are advisors\nwho would help you in finding one. They were able to find a position for me, and I still work till today. The process took\nlike two months but it was so worth it. I work as a lab tech although I study Psychology but it is a super easy job. \n2-Distractions: Try distracting yourself. Develop a hobby, go on walks, take long showers (this really helped me the most\nto be honest?, work out, read, learn a new language, draw, etc?\n3-Take advantage of the free resources at your college: Join clubs in stuff that interests you. I joined a philosophy club\nand I met some people there. Also, make sure to visit your tutoring center. I ended up being a close friend with one of\nthe tutors. Try to ask if your college has Conversation Hours (it?s for ESL students but anyone can join), the purpose of\nit is to learn English but you can find some potential friends there. Also, make sure to check out your student email\nbecause they send various events that you could join. \n4- Speak up!: I am a pretty shy person and I rarely speak to strangers. But you have to remember that unfortunately as\nforeigners, people will mostly be shy to approach us because they don?t know what to say. I ended up having many\nfriends when I spoke with more students. Mainly try to keep it school related (I usually stay in class when the lecture\nends and ask students about some stuff related to the class). One guy was really happy that I talked to him and he\nReddit Posts\nended up asking me about my home country, he was extremely interested to talk to someone ?international.?\n5- Invest in your hobbies: Personally, I love movies, and I found out that AMC has a subscription for 22$ that enables\nyou to watch 12 movies a month. If you like working out, invest in a gym. If you like cooking, try to cook more, etc?.\nI hope that these advices will help you. \nAs for your questions. I do not think that you can take a gap semester although you can go to your country in the\nsummer! If you have an F1 stamp on your passport, then it is perfectly fine for you to go. You just need to talk to your\nDSO so they can sign your I-20 or something like that. I unfortunately can?t leave because I don?t have a stamp (I\nchanged my status in the US.)\nI promise you that it gets better. Just remember that this time is a huge investment for your future. Although I have some\nfriends here. I still feel homesick, and I tend to feel lonely some nights (which is why I started to sleep early, it helps!)\nFeel free to DM me if you wanna talk more about this.\nHave a good one.\n"

I've found this site which seems to accurately state all the knowledge I was able to gather:\n[https://epicflightacademy.com/flight-school-faq/how-do-i-apply-for-uscis-permission-to-transfer-schools/](https://epicfligh\ntacademy.com/flight-school-faq/how-do-i-apply-for-uscis-permission-to-transfer-schools/)\nI would have been able to manage if they had only terminated me, as I could just fill in the I-539 and the new I-20 from\nthe transfer-in school, submit that to USCIS and continued with me course with the new school, but now things are\ncomplicated as my school has played extremely dirty with me by putting in a request for reinstating me so that they\ncould \"trap me\" or ultimately force me to leave the country. There are so many things I would have liked to share but to\nnot make this post long, I have just stuck to the facts. The owner has put me in a lot of anxiety which has led me to\nmajor depression, I am thankful to my parents and friends who've been supporting me which has kept me going.\nThank you for reading this far, hoping to hear from all of you!\nReddit Posts\n&#x200B;\n": [

        "I replied to other comments but I never made my own comment so here it is. I hope this helps. I added\nall the information that I've researched myself the past year while I was looking for options if things don't work out for\nReddit Posts\nme. Hopefully this is organized enough and helps. If anyone have any comments or information to add onto this or have\nany corrections please do! The more information the better! It will help others in the same situation.\n***Options you have***:\n* **Canada**:\n   * Use [this](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) link to calculate your Comprehensive Ranking\nSystem (CRS) score. If your score is above 540, then you can apply for Canadian PR and might actually have a chance\nat getting it within 6 months to a year I believe. I know the wait time for the PR might be longer than 3 months however\nyou can go back home while you wait for the PR. Once you get it you can move to Canada and look for jobs there.\n   * If your company has an office in Canada, you can ask for them to send you to their Canadian office. I'm not sure how\neasy it is to get a Canadian work visa but no matter how difficult it is to get it, it won't be on the same level as an H1B\nLOL. Once you go there you can apply for a PR as soon as you are eligible. Just do some research on it.\n      * If this ends up being an option, and if you get promoted to a manager position and work there for 2 years and then\ngo back to the US, I believe you qualify for the EB-1 C category of the employment based (EB) greencard category. You\nwill get your greencard very fast (unless you were born in India or China)\n   * If you get PR and eventually become a Canadian citizen, you can apply for a TN visa and then move to the US for\nwork. As far as I know, you can work in the US indefinitely on the TN visa. However, if you want to get a greencard, you\ncan't get one through the TN visa as there is no pathway to citizenship for this visa and you need to maintain\nnon-immigrant intent. If you want to get a greencard when you're on a TN visa then you have to apply for an H1B visa\nagain and go through the lottery or any dual-intent work visa. The only advantage in this option is that even if you don't\nget picked in the H1B lottery, you still have your TN visa so you can try again unlike when you're on a STEM OPT when\nyou have a limited amount of tries.\n* **O1 visa**:\n   * If you have the required qualifications and are eligible for this visa, you can apply for it at any time of the year and get\nReddit Posts\nthe visa. The eligibility criteria is very strict though so it's hard to get it but it doesn't hurt to check it out and try if you\nmeet the criteria.\n* **Marriage**:\n   * If you have a US citizen significant other, and both of you want to get married then this is your best option. You can\nget married and your significant other can apply for a greencard. You'll get it within a few months to a year and then after\n2.5 or 3 years you can become a citizen!\n* **Masters**:\n   * If you can afford a masters, you can get one and get another chance of employment and another 3 years of STEM\nOPT if you do a masters in an eligible major. This way you have another 3 years to try for an H1B\n* **Non-Profit (Cap-exempt H1B visa)**:\n   * This is an option I learned recently. I believe you are eligible for a cap-exempt H1B visa if you work for a non-profit\norganization like say an accredited university or college. You can bypass the lottery through this way and get the visa\nfaster.\n   * *Disadvantage*:\n      * When you switch to a job that is not cap-exempt, you're gonna have to switch to a regular H1B visa and go through\nthe lottery again. <-- this one I'm not fully sure about but that's what I heard.\n      * Fewer jobs available that qualify for cap-exempt H1B and probably even fewer willing to sponsor\n      * Salary is likely going to be lower\n   * Make sure you do more research for this option\n* **Worst Case Scenario**:\n   * The only option you have when everything fails is going back home.\n* Some people mentioned getting a greencard from outside the US. This is possible as far as I know. I don't fully know\nthe details so you're gonna have to do some research on your own for this. I do know however that this is impossible for\nIndians and Chinese so if you were born in one of those two countries just give up and go through the other options I\nmentioned. If those don't work then going back home is your best option.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

    " Accidentally worked more than 20hours/week on campus\nBody of the post: I have received paychecks for 40.25 hours biweekly instead of my 40 hour biweekly limit twice. It\nhappened because of clocking out a few minutes late on some shifts and they paid me extra for those minutes. I am\ngetting really worried since it is a violation of my F-1 Visa Limitations.

        "It will be up to the DSO whether or not to take any SEVIS termination action. Some people here seem\nto think it's an HR topic; it's not. It's an immigration status topic. The US government says you can't work more than 20\nhours per week on-campus (except during breaks). \nMany DSOs would not take any SEVIS termination action for such a small (in time over worked) status violation. Some\nDSOs may not see any level of wiggle room in the regulations and may terminate a SEVIS record for even a small\namount of time worked over the F-1 limits. So, the SEVIS part is the decision of the DSO at this point.\nYour F-1 status is though with the US government, not the school/DSO. Your SEVIS record is not your F-1 status. You\ncan violate your F-1 status without a DSO terminating your SEVIS record. \nIf a DSO ignores an infraction, it doesn't mean it technically didn't happen. Ultimately, if the US government somehow\ngets record that you worked over the limit, it's their decision about what that means for your F-1 status with them. \nAgain, for so few minutes over the limit, it is very _unlikely_ it will be a serious problem for you now or in the future. But\nReddit Posts\nthe people of Reddit don't ultimately make that decision.

For example, a person can be issued a single-entry three\nmonth student visa, travel to the US and be admitted as a F1 for D/S, and study for years lawfully, even though the visa\nwas used up the moment they arrived.  All that is to say that the visa being revoked does not impact her status in the\nUS.  If the DUI involved something more serious like an accident involving manslaughter or another serious crime, she\ncould be put into deportation proceedings.  \nNot to minimize the seriousness of her DUI, but for a routine DUI it will have no impact on her status,  If she departs the\nUS since the visa was revoked she will need a new visa to return.  In most cases for a DUI, the student would reapply\nand as long as the officer believes they remain a legit student and qualified for the visa, the officer will send them to the\npanel physician to assess whether they have an addiction (alcohol) that makes them ineligible for a visa under US law. \nIf the doctor assesses they do not, then they can be issued a new student visa.\nIt sounds from your post and the comment below that she understands the seriousness of this event, which is good, and\nvery lucky this learning experience wasn't more serious.  I'm glad she gets it, and is getting better DSO advice, and wish\nyou and her well!\n- ",

        "As someone who was in the same exact position, let me tell you that everything you?re feeling is valid.\nIt?s definitely stressful and hectic, not to mention the looming uncertainty and anxiety that just ruins your day. Sad thing\nis that it only goes away slowly once the job offer is in hand, the good thing is that you will definitely land something,\ndon?t lose hope. Until it?s your last hour in the U.S, keep applying as it?s a volume game unfortunately for international\nstudents.

        "I feel you, I?m going thru the same since a few months. This is going to be a bit direct. Here are some\ntips I?d like to share with you: \n? reach out to your professors and ask for a volunteer position. Ask for a small teams meeting and discuss your\nsituation. Do this as soon as you can before your EAD start date. Usually takes time for HR to process internally.\n? do not spiral. Prioritize your health. Seriously, this is very important. Have a proper routine because this is going to\ntake a while and a system helps you keep stable. Do not overload yourself with too many applications in one day. Apply\nReddit Posts\nmax 20 jobs per day. Maximize on quality. Write that cover letter, attach the portfolio, certifications and publications.\nMake sure you actually qualify for the minimum job requirements - degree, years of experience and skills. \n? since you have gotten interviews already, you?re doing something right. Figure out what is that you did that landed\nyou interviews and do that more. If you wanna go extra, reach out to these recruiters and ask them what made your\napplication stand out to them, hopefully have a call too. \n? prioritize which job titles you want. Don?t waste your time applying to anything and everything. Don?t use LinkedIn\neasyApply feature unless it?s a position that you really like. This just gives you the illusion that you?ve applied to many\njobs but in fact they usually keep reposting. Apply directly thru company website. \n? have a professional from LinkedIn read and critique your resume. Ideally, this person has to be in a company and\nposition you?d like to be in. Ask for a call when they accept your request for resume review. Don?t use InMail feature.\nNobody responds, but definitely send personalized connections requests to people relevant to your field. A lot of people\nare willing to have a chat. One thing - try to make your resume ATS friendly, easy to read, but also unique. Have wider\nmargins, only relevant content and skills. \n? make a list of companies you actually want to work for. Have an easy access links to their careers website. Go to the\nH1B database website and see if they have sponsored visas in 2023-2024. If I come across a new company, I just\nGoogle ?company name + H1B? and quickly check thru the first 3 links. Check the company career page every week for\nnew positions. Don?t even bother with companies that don?t sponsor, whether you need sponsorship or not. It?s a\ndance you don?t have time for. \n? go to job fairs and network on LinkedIn. Job fairs - ask recruiters for business cards and send a LinkedIn request by\nend of day. For LinkedIn- try to connect with employees (not just recruiters) in the company and ask about company\nReddit Posts\nculture. Usually people are more responsive 2 pm onwards. Keep 3 special days in a week to connect with people on\nLinkedIn so you don?t overload yourself. The main focus here is to build rapport, have a chance to talk to employees of\nthe company and hopefully get a referral. \n? this may or may not work. Instead of matching keywords to job description using ChatGPT, I chose the job titles that I\nwant and made resume docx for each of them. This takes a little practice since you will need to read a few job\ndescriptions completely and get a feel for what types of wordings/skills these job titles usually require. Usually let?s say\nyou?re aiming for 6 job titles, then you 6 editable word files and 6 finalized resume PDFs. Have a website highlighter\nextension handy and add the missing keywords. If everything crucial is present, then use the uncustomized PDF. \n? more than anything, it?s about your mindset and belief. Of course the market is bad right now. But don?t lose faith,\nkeep telling yourself that you will find a job in the moments of doubt and keep pushing thru. This became much more\neasier for me once I started talking to people on LinkedIn. Just merely talking to humans made me feel less alone. \nYou got this ?\n- ",

    " Just tired\nBody of the post: Hi everyone. \nI'm an international student graduating with a B.S. in CompSci this December and I have no job lined up. Looks like I'm\ngoing back home.\nMy time at college here in the US has been a mess. In sophomore year, I had to go back home during COVID since it\nwas cheaper to take virtual classes without paying for housing. I spent the whole year studying with a 12-hour\ndifference. I remember having to sit for one class at 2am-3am and then wait to attend another at 6am-9am. I was pretty\ntired but I managed to pull through with my gpa still somewhat intact. Plus, also completed a Google summer program at\nthe time called SPS.\nOnce junior year started, I came back to the US. The transition back was hard. I don't know what it was but COVID\nscrewed me up. I couldn't focus during class and I started falling behind. I got really depressed and started to skip\nclasses. I was spending most days in bed just battling suicidal thoughts. I never really felt good enough for CS and I was\nconstantly doubting myself. I was failing myself and my family who were supporting me. But I sought out help from\nReddit Posts\nmental health services on campus and attended therapy regularly. I started to get better and worked on fixing my\ngrades. \nIn senior year, I decided to do an independent study analyzing COVID data. My advisor helped me to apply and I got to\nattend a conference (NCUR) to present my work this spring. I also applied for and got to intern this summer at a U.S.\nDepartment of Energy lab as well. I worked on a research project that I'm currently still working on and planning on\npublishing with my mentor from there.\nBut now comes the end. I've applied to 200 jobs currently (data analyst, software engineer) at companies, institutions\nand research labs at universities. I've gotten nothing. I'm not expecting to get a six-figure salary, just a job even if it's in\nthe middle of Nebraska or something. \nI didn't attend a prestigious school nor did I do any amazing projects. My department has offered me no help (for\ninternational students especially) in terms of career prospects. I had to seek out my internship on my own. \nI've been through one thing after another. I'm exhausted. I'm sure others have been through much worse than I have. I\njust wanted to come to America so I could find a life here and escape my homophobic country. I feel defeated for getting\nnothing. \nI've been accepted for a master's at my current school but I'm waiting to get a Graduate Assistant position so I can get\nfree tuition. However, that's gonna have to be deferred to the Fall. Also applying for a PhD program at another uni. I've\nbeen talking to the PI/Faculty for that as well. If I get in, it will also be in the Fall.\nI'm sorry for complaining, I hate doing that. I just needed to rant. I'll just work on projects and LeetCode while I'm at\nhome.\nReddit Posts\nRant over.\nUPDATE:\nI've decided to apply for OPT now to continue my job search. I'll talk with my international office advisor to plan out my\nnext course of action.\nI've had my resume reviewed by my previous mentor I had from my Google summer program and my current mentor\nfrom my internship. They both said it's good. I used the \"Jake's Resume\" template recommended by everyone on the CS\nsubreddit.\nCurrently, I've been applying to more jobs that are more closely aligned with my skills and research experience from my\ninternship.\nIt seems my plan now is:\n- Apply for OPT, apply to jobs, see if I can get an opportunity\n- No job, admitted to PhD, go home and work until time to return for PhD\n- No job, not admitted to PhD, go home and work until time to return for master's\nI'll keep on trying.

    " F1 Visa with Interview Waiver Experience in India\nBody of the post: I think I was among the first ones to apply for a F1 visa with an interview waiver this year. I struggled to\nfind any resources like interview experiences or anyone to clear some doubts I had about the process, especially about\nfinancial documents. I went to the dropbox appointment with all these questions still unanswered, but luckily it was a\nvery straightforward process so there were no glitches.\nReddit Posts\nIf you qualify for an interview waiver (mentioned how to check eligibility at the bottom of the post), these are the\ndocuments that you need to carry with you:\n1. Passport with old US Visa\n2. 2 US VISA compliant passport size pictures\n3. i20\n4. Appointment Letter\n5. DS160\nNO FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS WERE ASKED.\nI carried the SEVIS Fee receipt with me but I was not asked to submit this document. I asked twice if it was required but\nI got a straight ?NO?.\nSo that was it on the documents front. Now to the experience:\nI had my document drop-off scheduled at 10:15 AM at Hyderabad VAC. It?s located right next to the Rasoolpura Metro\nStation. Outside the OFC you have a lot of facilities like printing shops, lockers, restaurant, photo studio etc. For the\ndocument drop-off here you need to make sure you are not carrying any electronic items with you. Usually you will have\none or the other gadgets like mobile phone, smartwatch etc with you. So just use the locker facility. I don?t remember\nhow much they charge but it was nominal (100-200 only). It?s worth the pain of not having to travel to the VAC without\nyour phone.\nShow your appointment letter at the entrance, stand in line, enter the facility, submit the documents, exit the facility with\nReddit Posts\na stamp on the appointment letter. DONE.\nAfter almost 7-8 business days, I received a mail that my passport was ready for pick-up. I had given the Chennai\nlocation as my passport pickup point. This particular point is NOT the American Embassy in Chennai. It?s an VAC in\nChennai. Take a copy of your Indian Govt ID (Aadhaar or Driving Licence) and wait in queue. Collect your passport\nwhen your turn comes. DONE.\nNOTE: there is no restriction on electronic gadgets when you go to collect your passport from the Chennai VAC. At max\nthe security personnel will ask you to switch off your devices.

I moved here about 10 years ago and the following has been my timeline since:\n1) 5 years of undergrad including about a year of internships/coop\n2) 3 years of OPT work\n3) 1.5 years of grad school\n4) Almost a year job searching since\nHaving spent so much time and money here, and now with just about 4 months left to find a job, I've been questioning\nwhether my life here has been worthwhile. \nIf I had spent all that time building experience in my home country, I might have been in a better position to move to\nCanada, somewhere in Europe, etc. Ultimately, I'm left feeling like it hasn't been worth it because I always wanted to live\nhere long-term, and until this year, I didn't have the capacity to understand how difficult that would be. \nReddit Posts\nMy first job search was relatively easy and I figured if I got a master's degree in computer science, I'd have an even\neasier time at least finding a job. That definitely wasn't the case and it's been a huge wake up call. I've barely been\ninterviewed and have had countless rejections over sponsorship requirements. At this point I'd be happy to just get a bit\nof work experience before heading home.\nI've been dating my partner (US citizen) for almost 6 years now and we've been talking about marriage as a way for me\nto stay, but neither of us feel ready to be married so it doesn't feel right. Neither of us want to get married just to keep\nme here.\nThis past year has been a struggle for me. I'd love to hear from anyone:\nWhat has your journey been like, and has it been worth it?\n": [

        "Oh boy oh boy! I have quite the story for you. Almost the same story. But I have crossed the hump and\nam in a much more stable position now. \nI am from a third world country. Def had big dreams and effort to reward ration there was imbalanced. Hence I aimed for\nthe Greatest country in the world. Lol. The USA. \nI landed in the US after years of planning and preparation. The education was phenomenal. Lived in all the major cities,\nNYC, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, SF. I was loving my younger days and having full fun but then as a norm, I got into an\nage where I had to plan my life. That's when it hit me. US life is go fast, go hard, and balls to the walls approach. MY\ncousin is a US citizen and she had to take maternity leave and oh my god, that whole experience was so frustrating for\nher. The leave, being away from work, the disconnect with colleagues. She was a career driven woman but she also\nwanted to be a mom and oh boy, the company on paper accommodated her but in reality she was completely\noverlooked. For raise, for important decisions, bonuses. The same happens to men who take career gaps. If you are\nfortunate enough to work for a company who will retain you for 3 months you are gone, the company will more likely\nReddit Posts\nlearn to work around you and in the next layoffs your name might be on top. A lot of these are subjective offcourse, but\neveryone faces similar problems if not the same. Basically you will be punished if you are not going with the flow. \nI somehow got the mindset that money is everything while I was in US. I became laser focused on making money\nbecause my lifestyle was expensive. So the apparent choice was the middle east as I don't have any taxes. I didn't get\nlucky with the H1 lottery but I wasn't hurt. I anyway had this plan going on. \nNow I was making big bucks in Dubai and not paying any taxes. But again the same thing. Expensive lifestyle. I was not\nhappy with a decent car. I needed a luxury one. Higher spending. Save a decent chunk but not happy in general\nbecause here it was like you are on your own. No social safety net. No work life balance. Work work work. Married to\nwork basically. \nFinally I wanted to change this. I felt like I learnt more about myself and I wanted to be in a place where work is not\neverything. I wanted to develop simpler hobbies. I wanted to focus on my passions. Don't get me wrong. I am passionate\nabout my work. I love my work. But us and Dubai made me feel work is everything but this is bad! Any person should\nhave multiple passions and also keep exploring new things. Because if you have only 1 and it's not going well your days\nare depression and slow and you will not be that productive. (even the best employees have tough times now and then).\nIt's always good to have multiple things to rely on. Like gyming or hiking. A physical passion or hobbies is a boon on\ntimes of stressful work life. \nSo finally I moved to the EU. I know I might make it look easy or simple but trust me a lot of time has gone into planning,\nprepping. And a lot of reflecting and therapy sessions to really figure out the growth strategy for myself. \nThe EU has been great. People are generally smart. Cities are clean. Government work is quick. Alot of grunt work is\nsimplified. Food is so delicious and without chemicals. You get unlimited paid sick leave(up to 2 years in a single\nReddit Posts\ninstance so technically you could come back to work for a couple months and then take 2 more years off lol. But no one\nabuses this). My HR told me if I feel ill for as simple as mental fatigue, take a couple days off, I don't need to submit any\ndoctors letter). Basically EU is sustainable even after so many socialist policies is because people don't abuse benefits.\nThey don't have to. \nAgain, all of this might change in the next decade or so. But no one can predict it. USA can become the best country. Or\nsome 3rd world country is best place to be. For all I know I might move there. What matters to me is I am doing the best\nI can. I am doing things that matter to me. I am solving the problems I have instead of prolonging them. \nIf I am honest, not getting h1 should be a wake-up call to really look inward and figure out what you want from life.\nHaving h1 and getting paid bat shit crazy sometimes numbs you to your real self. \nAll the best buddy.\n- ",

I?m also not a STEM major, so I only get 1 year of OPT.\nC) The lifestyle you get on H1B sounds pretty exhausting. Less PTO compare to other countries, if the job is toxic and\nyou want to work for another company you eventually will have to move your H1B which is also a pain in the ass. \nAlso, I feel like I won?t have time and money for traveling. US domestic tourism is great but it only goes so far.\nD) The market isn?t good. My niche isn?t doing super bad but it?s not good either and I?m not sure if I can even find\ncompanies that potentially will sponsor my GC and without the GC I feel like I will always have the same problems and\nanxieties.\nReddit Posts\nE) I tried to do the math and see how fast I will be able to afford a house without the crazy grind in some cities/states I\nwant to live in and it made me sad because the answer was always somewhat between 20-30 years. If on top of that I\nwill have a kid (even one), my kid will have to be smart af and get a full ride or get a huge ass student loan.\nI definitely was looking into houses near bigger cities, however, my time in US showed me that I?m not a type of person\nwho can live in a suburbs with no nature, nothing to do and far away from everything, so if I stay in US I have to not only\nmove to a better state (better = more expensive) but also find a place closer to a big city which again means more and\nmore and more money. \nSo, I decided to look into jobs around the world as well. Obviously, in this case everything will depend on the country but\nI?m a bit more hopeful because while jobs in, for example, Europe will definitely bring less money, the cost of living is\nalso going to be lower. Getting a place in Europe (depends on the country of course) probably will take around 8-15\nyears. Additionally, the path to the RP and later citizenship seems to be slightly easier (still hard but). On top of that you\nget more PTO days, sick leaves, access to more countries and the jobs I was looking into would offer a help with\nrelocation. \nI guess I?m also more familiar with that region which makes me slightly more optimistic about it while I have never\nthought about living in Europe for real until this year.\nThose are things I?m keeping in mind when considering my next steps.

(TIS is 30k$ a year, BST is 22k$)\n\\-I chose A level over the IB program, since I had specific subjects I wanted to focus on, I didn't want to study Sciences\nthat I wouldn't utilize in the future\n\\-Well you probably moved schools at 14 so I doubt it was your choice, I think you parents put you there by their will\n(like... no?

        "Where did I go wrong in my interview?\nI got denied in my first interview and I?m aware that it?s because I failed to give a complete answer to one of the most\ncrucial questions the VO asked: ?Why did you choose a lesser education in business this time when you have\ncompleted a higher education in your own country??. I have prepared a lot for the interview and I thought I was ready\nbut I got too distracted by the people who were lining up beside the window where I was assigned to; they can hear our\nReddit Posts\nconversation which made me so anxious and I wasn?t expecting that would happen.\n(For context: I?m from the Philippines. I took a bachelor?s degree in physical therapy and I?m planning to pursue an\nassociate?s degree in business in Los Angeles City College (community college) because my goal is to build a rehab\ncenter in my hometown. I know this is a red flag, but I?ve done a lot of research and even consulted with a former visa\nofficer that there?s still a chance for you to get approved as long as you?re able to convince the VO about your real\nintent for getting a student visa.)\nSo I scheduled for another interview in the hopes that I?d be able to speak with much more confidence this time. I\nwasn?t expecting that I would be asked the same questions I received in my first interview. This is how it went:\nVO: Good morning! Where do you intend to go?\nMe: In Los Angeles, particularly to study in Los Angeles City College (I wanted to give more details and start explaining\nwhy I wanna study there but I was afraid she?ll just cut me off and get annoyed like what my first interviewer did)\nVO: What do you plan on studying there?\nMe: I want to take a 2-year associate?s degree in business (Again, I want to explain more but I?m afraid of giving much\ndetails that she didn?t even ask for)\nVO: Who will be your sponsor?\nMe: My cousin who is a US citizen will be the one to finance my education. She works as a game producer at the Riot\nGames company where she earns a salary of $xxx,xxx and she agreed to sponsor me with her savings. She also\noffered me a stay in her apartment which is just a 30-min drive away from the school which is convenient for me. She?s\ngonna provide me everything that I need once I get there.\nVO: What?s the highest education you attained?\nMe: I took a 5-year bachelor?s degree in physical therapy and during those first two years I was consistently the top of\nour batch where I have received a full refund of my tuition as a reward. I finished my studies in June 2020 and I took the\nReddit Posts\nboard exam in Dec 2021 which I successfully passed so now I?m a licensed physiotherapist.\n(The 1st and 2nd VO literally asked me the exact same questions, and I didn?t even get the chance to explain why I\nwant to pursue business, what my post-graduation goals are, my ties to the country, etc etc.)\nVO: You know that you were denied previously right in your first interview right?\nMe: Yes ma?am\nVO: I?m sorry but I really can?t approve your visa *hands me the blue paper*\nMe: I?m aware I was denied the first time because I wasn?t able to properly answer a question, but now I wanna take\nthis chance to explain myself better if you would allow me.\nVO: Go ahead\nMe: The reason why I want to study business is because I really want to put a rehabilitation center in my hometown\nbecause there?s a need for it. There?s only a limited number of physical therapists back there because of less hiring\nopportunities and so due to the lack of job prospects, fewer physical therapists are choosing to work in my hometown.\nAs a result, physical therapy services are not really available in my community, so I really wanna do my best to fill that\ngap and pursue my passion while helping the people back in my hometown.\nVO: I understand your reason but I?m sorry. You can refer to the blue paper if you want to know why I can?t approve\nyour visa.\nI really don?t know what to do now. I want to apply again for a third interview but I?m afraid I?m just gonna waste money\nagain. What do you guys think where I went wrong?\n- ",

I applied via document drop-off because I qualified for an interview waiver. \nA couple of days after I applied, I received an email saying my application had been refused under 221(g). And I was\nasked for the following documents:\n- CV/Resume, including list of publications and references\n- Detailed study/research plan and its practical application\n- Advisor/mentor?s CV/resume\n- University admission letter/employment offer letter\n- Source of funding for research or degree\nI submitted these documents online on the day I received the email. My passport was not returned to me. However,\nReddit Posts\nsince I had a valid F-1 visa, my DSO advised me to see if I could get my passport back and try to travel on my old visa. I\ncalled the embassy to ask them if my old (unexpired) visa had been cancelled and they said no. I submitted the request\nfor temporary passport withdrawal. However, I didn't receive my passport in time and my F-1 expired.\nEventually, though, my temporary passport withdrawal request was processed and I did get back my passport, and in it,\nmy old visa had been \"cancelled without prejudice\" (apparently the Embassy operators had given me the wrong\ninformation prior) and I had a pink 221(g) slip. \nAnyway, now I am kind of stuck in my home country until 221(g) is cleared.

The\nregion I live in, however, barely has such an industry and salaries are so low that I can't make such a lifestyle shift going\nfrom making that much money as a 15-18 year old with barely any stress then as I graduate college I do literal slave\nReddit Posts\nwork for a job that I despise in exchange for like 1k USD a month.\nAnyways I graduate on the second week of June and I've been stalling saying that it takes time to register a new bank\naccount on Roblox because I recently changed banks but this isn't gonna last for very long, eventually I'm gonna have to\nconfront him and refuse and when that happens I don't know what I'll do cause he might kick me out or attack me and he\nhas all my documents and such and I still need to attend school and my graduation and need an address so I don't see\nhow I can become free of him.\nHe doesn't want me studying there and will do anything to stop it, he even told me if I go there and abandon him he'll fly\nover and chase me down and put a bullet in my head I'm not sure if he was joking but one thing I know for sure is he\nREALLY doesn't want me going.\nI've got average grades, 3.0 GPA, 1010 SAT score (although that's from a score I took on march to try out the bluebook\nsystem I'm gonna retake it in June and possibly get a better score)\nRoblox is not stable at all and I might not be making any money soon or might be rich there's no way of knowing but I'm\ntrying to prepare for the worst case scenario rather than the rarer best.\nI'm interested in studying business or comp sci, mostly leaning towards comp sci since I've heard that even for product\nmanagers in the tech industry they prefer someone with a technical degree/background. My relatives live around\nChicago, Indiana, Michigan just overall around that area/side. I'm aware a lot of what I'm saying is irrelevant, I'm just\ntrying to provide as much info as possible.\nSo my main questions are do you think my goal is realistic, should I bother trying, how to gain independence, how do I\ndeal with my father, and what steps can I take to stay in the country after studying and how should I go around getting\nReddit Posts\nthe f1 visa?\nBonus question: For my grades and situation do you know any colleges with a decent rank that I got a good chance of\ngetting admitted to? preferably under 30k a year (for internationals).\n": [

Drexel also has 6 month co-op system which can\nget you enough savings to support you financially for at least one term after the co-op.

As far as I know, she just checked the\nbox for need for sponsorship and said she need a sponsorship to the hiring manager during her interview. Lots of\nmanagers told her they would reach out after talking to HR and never gave her a job. One company finally said yes we\nwould sponsor you but the contract is 3 years. She accepted the offer ofc. We are in healthcare field so it can be very\ndifferent in general companies.\n- ",
        "Honestly, I network and talk to people from smaller/mid-size companies. Those companies gave me a\nchance even if they are not familiar with the process, as long as I understand it. Bigger firms generally have a system in\nplace that if you are international, most positions you aren't even considered since the screening round. I have worked\nReddit Posts\nfor a small company after my Undergrad OPT. I am working for one now in Masters' OPT and they are willing to enroll in\nE-Verify so I can extend my STEM OPT with them. Don't think I coulda gotten much flexibility in a bigger firm.\n- ",
        "Our department?s executive was a H1 holder himself from India, and he was very compassionate\nabout the visa situation even from the beginning. I was hesitant to ask for work visa sponsorship, but he reassured me\nand other visa holder employees that the company will do anything within their reach for visa matters. I guess I just got\nlucky. I think it helps a lot if your manager was a visa holder themselves since they already know visa types and other\nmeasurements more than the HR itself.\n- ",
        "Am I the only person to find volunteering stupid?! Like you earn no money while living in one of the\nmost expensive countries on earth. Apply for masters or returning home is would be my option if I really wanted to find a\njob in the U.S.\n- ",
        "Got hired by a non-profit. They don?t have to deal with the lottery to get their people H1. Worked there\nfor a year then got into one of the big tech companies. Big tech doesn?t care about your visa status, they have an army\nof lawyers to figure it out for them.\n- ",
        "For me I checked the box that asks if you will need to be sponsored and when the recruiter, for the\ncompany I am currently working for called, I told him too (because the recruiter also asked me) and they were like ok the\nimmigration team will be in touch. And they were in touch ...\n- ",
        "A few things that I will tell you having gone through it successfully. \n1. Where you went to school does matter. It matters especially if you are moving to a major city, which you likely want to\ndo given there are more career opportunities. This is because given sponsorship can be expensive, employers have to\nview you as an asset to consider going through the process. They are much more likely to do this if you graduated from\na top program in your field than a mid-tier school. A lot of people won't like this but it's true. I've seen it with myself and\nothers. \nReddit Posts\n2. Speaking English very well as well as other useful languages can give you an edge in certain career fields such as\neducation, research, academia, law and sometimes financial careers, though less so. \n3. Having work experience helps a lot, but the most useful thing is to NETWORK. This is where how high your school\nranks comes into play. Having access to that network is key for internationals because you don't have as many\nconnections in the US as your American peers. I cannot tell you how much I networked. It was how I secured my current\nand several other positions. \n4. Have a skill or something to offer that stands out or that is uncommon in Americans: ie translation experience,\nlanguage skills, specializations in highly uncommon but necessary fields, etc. A lot of Americans only speak English,\nhave not lived or interned abroad and may have less experience working with diverse populations. A lot of internationals\nhave these things already by virtue of being international. Look and apply for jobs that require these skills and prioritize\nthese things. You will have an easier time. \n5. This one helps A LOT. But only apply to companies or organizations that have a track record of sponsoring or who\nhave current or previous staff that is international. They will be nicer and much more open and empathetic about this\nduring the interview process about your situation. Similarly, try to look for international alumni from your school and see\nwhere they work, then network with them. This is very helpful.\n- ",
        "Are you on initial OPT? if so, try finding a volunteer position relevant to your degree to stop the\nunemployment clock at the very least\n- ",
        "When you apply to companies, also check if they already sponsor for H1B and green card.\n- ",
        "1. Project yourself as an expert, not a newbie.\n2. Publish often on LinkedIn. \n3. Cold email, reach out to any/all LinkedIn connections for referrals. No response? Reach again, and again. \nReddit Posts\n4. Create a side project and use it to show your work. \n- ",
        "By actually being good.\n- ",
        "Unfortunately you've graduated at a time when there have been a lot of layoffs in the last 2 years in all\nindustries but especially in tech where the majority of the sponsorship happen. Pre-2023 it was a lot easier to get jobs\nwhich sponsored employees. It's difficult for companies to justify sponsorship in the midst of layoffs where a lot of US\ncitizens are also getting laid off.\nAll is not lost though, I would recommend to keep networking and reaching to alumni from your school, get informational\ninterviews and request them to refer you. Referrals have the highest chance of getting through. It's better if it's a small to\nmid sized company as the people who refer you can directly reach out to the HM/Recruiter to atleast get you an initial\ninterview. That being said keep also applying to jobs through job portals to cover all your bases.\n- ",

    " Re-entering the US after SEVIS termination - my experience! \nBody of the post: I know a lot of students who get their SEVIS terminated because of some or the other reason. Be it\nacademic dismissal, staying out of US for more than five months.   \nThis has been my personal experience. \nI did not know what to do and I did the whole process of applying for the F-1 visa again and got rejected but still was\nable to travel with my old visa. I called DHS, consulates, CBP everyone but got very vague answers. Some good folks\non Quora helped me.  \nReddit Posts\nI had a new offer letter and new I-20 from another univeristy this time. \nI know the major questions are if you should get a new F-1 visa or not, what will happen at the border patrol etc.\nIf you have been in a similar situation this post will help you. There is no proper information on the internet and it is a\nvery gray area because it highly relies on your reason on termination as well as the CBP officer upon entry. \nFirst off, once your SEVIS is terminated - don't violate by overstaying. Book a ticket to your home country within the\nspecific time period. No place safe than home.   \n  \nNext, academic appeal or health appeal your decsion in the university and wait for their reply (high chances they will\ndeny the same). If you are lucky and you get your appeal approved- the story ends there. They will activate your SEVIS\nnumber again and you can come back to the US. \nIf your appeal is denied - remember you DO NOT NEED a new F-1 Visa at all unless it is cancelled on your passport\nbecause of serious violation. It will be clearly visible in terms of cancellaion or you can check the same on this website -\n[https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx) \nThe name of Univeristy n your Visa DO NOT MATTER. \nIf it says active you don't need a new visa. If you ask consulate they will ask you to reapply. Your F-1 visa is valid until\nthe date on your visa. It is only for your entry in the United States - after that your I20 and SEVIS matter to go beyond\nthat. Think of it as a key to a lock for gate one and then SEVIS and I20 are the key for further doors. \nNow, you can't go on a terminated SEVIS so you need to either get a new admission or get your SEVIS tranferred to\nReddit Posts\nanother shool which will most definitely provide a new I20 and SEVIS ID. \nYou DO NEED TO pay the SEVIS fees again though in this whole process. \nMake sure you have your Valid F-1 visa, your new I-20 with updated SEVIS (your new university will updated your status\non DHS) and carry your old I-20 and SEVIS just in case.   \nUpon arrival the CBP officer asked for my F-1 visa, new I-20 and SEVIS and one question - \"Did you carry any alcohol\nor tobacco today?\" and I said no.   \nMake sure your new university understands the whole situation. They can help you in case you go for second\nquestioning (very unlikely) but apart from that nothing to worry about. Thousands of students change their school\neveryday so it is very common.

For example, if an applicant presents a letter from DHS dated December 1,\n2008, that says the applicant was out of status starting on May 28, 2001, the applicant began to accrue unlawful\npresence as of December 2, 2008, not May 28, 2001.\n- ",

They gave me names and Badge numbers. They called 5 more times when I\nhung up the phone and wouldn?t pick up anymore. They said I was going to get arrested if I talked about it to anyone or\nhung up as we talked since it was an ? on call? investigation and that it was recorded. \nThe fact that they knew my name definitely spooked me beyond measure , if you get this kind of calls ; DO NOT give\nthem any kind of information, my International office said it happened to a very frightened girl and she gave them\nSSN/Bank Account numbers.

In the case I am from Brazil and am interested in the STEM field, which I know you can extend\nyour OPT.\nThe H1b visa is the only option if you want to stay there besides doing graduation or masters, phd? Or is there\nsomething else? \nI really appreciate your help and sharing your experience.\n": [
        "Honestly it is much harder to get the job than to WIN the lottery. To put in perspective, you will do twice\nor more effort just to get a job willing to sponsor you and once you find one(if you do) there is a huge chance that you\nwont get the visa. I was employed by a company willing to sponsor. %70 of the employees were students and people\nkeeping their student status through master programs. Several years of them participating on the lottery and not get it.\nThe turnover was high not because of the company beings cutthroat but because people had to go back to their\ncountries.\nI don?t mention this to discourage you but sadly I was naive to not know until I experienced it firsthand. I am still on the\ngrind and looking for a way to stay.\nMost companies wont hire you because it?s not viable to hire someone with no experience and pay for all the costs of\nH1B. If possible I would research any american companies in your country. Come to study and do internships and use\nyour OPT on said company. If they are willing to sponsor after college, great, if not go back and work for them and\ncontinue applying to that company for a position in the U.S with you having more experience and being familiar with the\nReddit Posts\nindustry there?s a chance they are willing to bring you back.\nI only know of one person that did this and worked, take it with a grain of salt.\n- ",

I am just realizing that person who was accepting my documents did stupid thing by saying that I would not\nReddit Posts\nneed those documents. What should I Do!???????? Should I resubmit my documents by adding those 2 ?????\nUpdate:\nSorry all for severe delayed update but finally I got my F-1 VISA renewed. I lost access to this threaded.

Eventually he did\nnot took my EAD card ... and said that it is not required. After a week, I got refusal notice and immediately began looking\nfor the reason. I contacted the embassy and asked for the reason, and they said that I would have to book appointment\nfor physical interview. That time there were no available windows, and I had to monitor the website couple times a day.\nAnother week passed by, and I started calling/ emailing embassy to get me appointment. Then I got email notification\nthat there is window for the next day, and I needed to book that ASAP. Fast forward to that day ... I collected ALL my\ndocuments and all possible proof of employment to make sure I am going with 110% preparation. Interview with the\nofficer went pretty much straightforward, although ALL people before me were rejected for their TOURIST visas. I\nthought that it will affect the entire situation, but it did not.\nThe office asked about the company, position, and where I live. How I commute and how much I paid for my car. Then\noffice asked about proof of employment and what I do in my job. Conversation was easy but took about 35-45 mins. I\nthink the background check took long.\nApparently, the problem with dropbox was that 1) The entire file did not had my EAD card (the reason is above) and 2)\nthere was some discrepancy with my I-20 when i changed my major 2 years ago. I hope this helps ! Have a nice day\neveryone.\nUpdate 2.0\nTimeline wise - \nDropped my docs to dropbox, and after 4 days got refusal notice. Then started calling and trying to book appoitment,\nReddit Posts\nthat took additional 1 week. Interview got scheduled after 2-3 days. After passing physical interview, i got my passport\nback in 7-10 days. Total procedure took about 3-4 weeks. So, be prepared for larger period, something like month.

Does IRS care whether if I paid tax for my US income at my home country?** What happens if I spend months in\nsome 3rd country as a vacation and claim I have worked remotely?\n*So let's say I went to Mexico for vacation etc for 2 months and worked remotely for a US company, perhaps as a\nself-employed individual. Let's say you worked the 2 months in Mexico and 10 months in the US. Sprintax directs you to\nallocate the out-of US part of this income. As a result, your total federal income tax gets reduced.*\n*Option A: - If I was a Mexican citizen, that might create some tax liability for me. I am not sure about this.*\n*Option B: - If I am not a Mexican citizen and just went as a tourist, I guess it wouldn't be a problem for Mexico.

    " Is it worth putting money in a 401k?\nBody of the post: Considering h1b is not guaranteed and having to return to our home country is a real possibility, do\nyou guys still put money on a 401k? Would the money still be accessible if we leave the US for good?\nReddit Posts\n  \n": [
        "It's definitely worth it if your company matches your contributions and if you don't have financial\ndiscipline to save. Any withdrawals from 401k is taxed at 20%. If you withdraw it before you turn 59, you are required to\npay an additional 10% as penalty, thus increasing the effective tax paid by you to 30%. Consider your income is 100k.\nSuppose your company has a policy of matching 100% of your contributions upto 5% of your income. If you contribute\n5% i.e. 5k per year, your company contributes another 5k, for a total of 10k a year. If you withdraw it at the end of the\nyear, you pay 3k to the IRS, and are left with 7k. That's still 2k of free money. It also reduces the personal tax you pay.\nSo you'll now end up paying taxes on 95k instead of on 100k. It's really a no brainer decision to contrinute if your\ncompany matches. Plus, if your 401k account is managed by some financial companies, they invest it in a diverse\nportfolio and fetch good returns. I personally got 13.2% returns on my 401k account last year. I would have never\nachieved such returns if I personally managed my portfolio. \n  \nMy employer matches 200% of my contributions upto 5% of my income. That's like 10k of free money for every 5k I\ncontribute.  \nAnd yes, you can still withdraw it anytime you want even after you leave the US. You can also take loans against it when\nyou're in the US for cheaper interest rates.\n- ",
        "I started putting money once I got my h1b, my company matches 3% so I put 3%. It's free money and\nyou can take out if you want for a penalty or wait until retirement.\n- ",
        "I did at the start then stopped to have some cash for buying a house. Then started again and now\nstopped to buy another.\nReddit Posts\n- ",
        "You can also look up how a Roth ladder works to start converting funds from your 401k to Roth after\nyou leave the country. Oversimplified explanation would be every year you convert up until the lowest income bracket\nthreshold (and pay the tax on the converted portion) and after 5 years you withdraw that contribution penalty free and\nrepeat every year.\n- ",
        "I am putting money in 401K mostly to reduce my taxable income and because of the employer match. I\nwant to put money in ROTH IRA but I'll wait to see if my h1b gets picked up.   \n  \nTill then I am investing on my own, as it provides me the liquidity I need. Otherwise too much money 401k +ROTH gets\nlocked.\n- ",
        "Yes, you should always contribute to 401k or 403b(non profits) especially if your employer also\nmatches. Money in 401k also grows year over year based on your allocations, but you can typically easily get 8-10%\nreturns YoY on your 401k.\n401k contributions also help you reduce your tax burden as contributions you make are pre-tax, and your taxable\nincome reduces.\nIf you leave the US, you can encash whatever balance you have in 401k. If you withdraw money before retirement age\n(you can also withdraw money penalty free for certain situations like buying your first house etc.) , you pay a 10%\npenalty and the money is withheld at 22% federal tax rate. But the money itself is only going to be taxed at your normal\ntax rate, so if your blended tax rate is less than 22%, you will get money back as part of tax refund.\n- ",
        "I would suggest better keep your 401k like 6% and not max it out. Remaining pay taxes take that\namount and put on something else like ROTH IRA. Reason is you never know what your tax % might be in future and\nmaybe when you want to take 401k amount in your 60 you might end up paying 55% of tax based on tax system at that\ntime.\nReddit Posts\n"

    " To stay or to go? Decision-making help!\nBody of the post: Hi everyone, let me start by apologizing for having such a pessimistic view of my situation. I'm really\nsorry in advance I understand that I am very blessed and should be grateful of the opportunity I have before me, but I\ncan't help but feel dread around it too. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar position and what things you\nhad to consider before making a decision.\nMy situation is that my STEM OPT is about to end in June 2024. Just today, my employer informed me that we can\ndiscuss sponsorship when they have been very dismissive the past two years since they're a non-profit and I was told\n\"we don't do that here\". \nAnyway, in the past few months, I've come to terms with the fact that I am just not a strong enough candidate to be\nconsidered by other employers, or that finding an employer with sponsorship is very challenging at this time, and that my\ncurrent employer won't offer it. I honestly did not struggle to accept this (except the fact that I'm not employable)\nbecause I've always wanted to go back home, but the pressure from my family to stay and make it work weighs me\ndown so much. \nBack home, I have a boyfriend who I've been in a long-distance relationship with since 2019. I want to achieve new\nmilestones with him. I have friends who may have connections and job opportunities for me. I will never earn as much as\nI do in the US, but my quality of life would be very different. \nIf I am offered the work visa, and choose to accept, I'm not sure how I can progress in my personal life given that my\ncurrent employer is a non-profit, and I am severely underpaid. Even if I stay, I will still not be able to afford to live\nindependently with my current salary. If I end up marrying my boyfriend and for some miracle, I'm able to petition him,\nand he can come here, I don't know what our lives would be like if I'm the salary maker and I get paid $46k a year in\nNew York City and he won't have a job right away because we have very different profiles. \nReddit Posts\nIf I choose to go back to my home country, I will leave my family behind here in the US. I will, yet again, make another\njump and restart in my home country and figure out what work opportunities would be there for me. I may find better jobs\nnow that I have an MA, but I'm so jaded, I don't know what to think anymore. I also still have to pay off my tuition to my\nsister who sponsored my education, it'll take me longer to do that if I don't earn USD.\nI don't want to sound like I'm whining about these good options that I have... I am very grateful, but this journey has truly\nbeen a constant mental and emotional battle. I wish a lot more people knew about our struggles as international\nstudents and the decisions we have to make. \nSorry for the drama. A heartfelt thank you to anyone who can share some wisdom and advice. \n": [

I know people who didn?t get it on first try but got it second try. If you are\nalready considering moving back home, there?s literally no harm in applying for work visa.

I chose home because even though I'd earn\nsignificantly more money here, I think I'll be happier there. I understand that this might be a tougher decision for you\nconsidering your parents are in US and you're in a long distance relationship with someone from your home country. In\nmy opinion, the question comes down to what makes you happy. If you take the H1B route, you'll probably get approved\nand if you get married to your SO then he would be able to work here, but again there are a few things to clarify before\nthis i.e is the SO okay/cool coming and working here, are you okay with working at the non profit, where do you love\nliving more, here or your home country. If you decide to go back to your home country, you'll probably need to again\nanswer some things, i.e. is it okay for you to stay away from your parents, it okay with you that you'll probably need more\ntime to repay your sister, is it okay with you to start kinda from scratch again.

So much so that their family's decade's\nof savings/real-estate investment would total it. \nSo students do the following\n- try to get great scores in order to score a scholarship\n- put the family's wealth, includes jewellery/real-estate of parents/extended-family's assets as a collateral and get an\neducation loan ( in recent times, the paperwork around it has reduced by a lot ) \nWhen they come to the states, they try to reduce expenses\n- by sharing apartments and not spending much on coffee/outside-food, etc\n& increase the earning \n- by working on the school offered positions (TA, library person etc)\nAlong with that, they have this understanding that their parent's life's earnings are dependent on them securing a decent\njob so they try and stay away from distractions. This necessity adds the required discipline to get into good firms. \nFrom their on, the immediate goal is to get rid of the education loan. As we usually have just 1-2 years of allowed work\npermit. So they save more, pay the loan off in that amount of time. Some lucky people get picked in h1b lottery and then\nthey can stay for 6 years. \nPost that if company ever decides to apply for a green card ( requires a lot of money ) and it gets approved ( takes\naround 2 years ), they get in a queue.

    " F1 Visa Experience Delhi \nBody of the post: [F23, Indian and about to pursue my masters degree.] \nMy interview was on 11th June 2024 (I'm a bit late to the party with posting late and all but anyway).   \nInterview time : 8am\nBut I reached there around 6:30am because a day before, I was overwhelmed with the how bad traffic in Delhi could be\n?\nReddit Posts\nBut even at 6:30am there was a big crowd of people right outside the Embassy. There were a lot of people at the\ninterview. Around 7-7:30am we were asked to form a line and enter the US Embassy. We were called one by one in\nfront of different counters initially to get our biometrics verified (which was done by Indian officers) and then formed\nanother line for the actual interview. \nWhen it was my turn for the biometric verification, my DS-160 form was kept with the officer (who was indian) and they\nasked me to sit aside which made my nervousness get even worse. I thought something was wrong with my form and\nthat I was totally screwed and never getting my visa but I asked one of the interns there and they said that I was a\ntransfer case which meant that my DS-160 had a different consulate address because I initially booked another\nconsulate before I rescheduled my consulate to Delhi. I let out a huge sigh of relief after realising it wasn't anything else.\nThough I had to wait for like 15-20 minutes and people who were behind me in the line were done with their interview\nbefore me but I didn't mind that much. \nAfter the Indian officer confirmed that my details have been transfered from my initial consulate to Delhi consulate, I was\nmade to stand in the line for my interview. Though I was feeling queasy, I tried not to think about it much. What I\nobserved about interviewees before me getting rejected was that their answers sounded really really scripted and\nmugged up. Keeping your tone natural and actually having a conversation with VO might work better in your favour. This\nisn't to say you shouldn't prepare your answers beforehand. But don't sound like it. \nI was made to stand in front of counter numbered 18 or 19??? Idk I don't remember. But it was a young American man,\nprobably in his early 30s who was my VO.\nI saw three people before me in line getting rejected with made it harder for me to keep calm but I tried anyway. So this\nis how it went :\nReddit Posts\n(I tried to maintain eye contact to the VO though he kept his gaze set on his computer screen almost the entire time.) \nME: Good morning, Officer. \nVO :Good morning, please hand me over your passport and I-20. \nME : Here you go.. *hands them over*\nVO: *He reads my i-20 for a while*\nSo what is Information Technology (the name of my course) ? \nME : Well, Information Technology is yada yada yada yada...(I said 2-3 lines and kept it short and simple)\nVO :  When did you graduate? \nME : I graduated in May 2022. \nVO : And what have you been doing since then? \nME : Well since then I've been working as a xyz where my job role is to analyze abc with the help of technology for\nbetter decision-making and now I want to pursue this degree to understand the finer aspects of technology as well as\nbusiness. \n*VO spends around 5 seconds quietly typing something on the screen.*\nReddit Posts\nVO : Who's funding your education? \nME : My parents are funding my education. They have savings of around xxx rupees and I've taken out an education\nloan of around xxx rupees. \n*VO spends another 10 seconds typing aggressively and gaze dead set on the screen. At this point I was freaking out\non the inside because the 10 seconds of silence has never been louder and longer for me..*\nVO : (while still looking at his screen) Approved. \nME : (I HAVE NEVER FELT SO RELIEVED) Thank you so much Officer.\nAnd then I scurried out of the building before getting lost inside the embassy and taking another 2 minutes in search of\nan exit. \nThey kept my passport and I received it after 3-4 days. \nThe entire interview barely lasted more than 1.5 minutes. Now that it's done, I now wonder what was I even worried\nabout in the first place. But I understand that weird overwhelming anxiousness you get until it's finally done.\n \nTips that helped me : \n1. Keep it short, simple yet crisp, cohesive and persuasive. The VO is NOT there to listen to your entire life story and so,\ndo not ramble (which is a problem I had to deal with). It might irritate the VO when you talk on and on without a point in\nReddit Posts\nsight esp when they have like 30 people more in line to interview. \n2. You lead the interview with your answers: If there are any loopholes in your answers that do not knit an easily\ndigestible and sensible story of what happened to what you currently are doing to what you will do in the future that\nmakes getting the visa a crucial stage in your life then the VO might ask you a question you have no answer to. Have a\ntight knit storyline in your head for you to follow according to the question asked. Sit down, think and make notes about\nwhy your background is relevant to what you are currently doing and how it would affect you in the future. This will help\nyou shape your answers in a cohesive and persuasive way that is unique to your situation and could help the VO\nunderstand why you need their approval.\n3. Make eye contact and try to appear confident in your answers and reasoning, even if you feel like you are peeing your\npants. Trust me, it works. \n4. Make a list of all the potential questions that the VO might ask and then frame, polish and enhance your answers\naccordingly. You don't have to learn your answers by heart, line to line before enacting it before the VO but you must\nknow the content you're gonna say if a certain question is asked. \n5. I can't stress this enough, keep the tone conversational and natural. Like you are having an actual conversation rather\nthan sounding like a tape recorder. This isn't to say that you keep it informal but I think that goes without saying. \nReddit Posts\n6. I think it's obvious and everybody here knows it already but do not display intentions of being a potential immigrant. \nI think that's all the info I had. If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer!! \n": [

You could look into volunteering with a local non-profit.\nReddit Posts\n-If you are eligible for STEM extension (check with your DSO on your degree?s designation) be sure to mention it during\nyour interviews. You will need to educate most prospective employers on how your visa works. Most simply do not have\nthe understanding on student visas.\n-I believe Contract work, aka 1099 employment, is allowed under OPT (again, check with your DSO). I?m not sure how\npopular this option is in your field, but it is an option you can explore.\nFinally a reminder that a student visa is not an immigrant visa.

I did my masters (non-CS) worked for a year using my OPT,\ncouldn?t get a job in an e-verified company to extend my OPT for two more years, so went ahead and pursued Ph.D.\nReddit Posts\nstudies which I finally finished in 2016 and got on OPT again for the second time with a higher degree and used it for\nthree more years before getting on H1B. \nAnyway, based on my experience, U.S. is a land of opportunities with definitely lesser competition compared to\ncountries such as India or China with huge populations. Especially, more so, in STEM fields where there is a definite\nlack of available local workforce. Majority of American citizens don?t even attend college, especially in STEM fields, as\nthey deem it expensive and tougher to finish. This is where the immigrant intake has helped sustain the U.S. in spite that\nlack of local STEM workforce. That is why you see a lot of immigrants in STEM fields.

I am currently on F1 OPT.\nGot a call from a pretending ICE agent, the number was really from an ICE office; they also called me with the number\nfrom the police in my city to pretended they had a warrant against me. The ICE agent will pretend that you have to do\nthe immigration bond and send the money before getting arrested. That I couldn't tell anyone about this while I was\ngetting investigated otherwise it would show that I have bad intentions and it will be against me in court. I know I should\nhave seen it sooner but he didn't ask for money just at the beginning, he was really pretending to investigate me and\nasking a lot of questions about my intention in the US and so on... I spent maybe 3 hours on a call with him and the\npolice calling me continuously to scare me before I sent the money. He showed me the papers, the Immigration Bond\nform and explain it to me and let me read through it. Even after he got the money he still played the game that he would\nsee me the day after with the papers done, and I still got in call with him for a few hours after he got the money for sure.\nSo I didn't sleep well because I was still thinking of being arrested and going to court. But in the morning when he said\nthat there was a possible bank account in my name (then he waited maybe 1 hour so that his chief can check\neverything), then that I might have been a victim of identity theft and that's why everything was happening in the first\nReddit Posts\nplace; then he asked me for more money (because the police had a new warrant because of the bank account that I\ndidn't report) but that got sketchy when I told him I had no money left and he told me to ask someone in the US and I\ncould just send him as much as possible (I was like \"but wait the amount is not fixed? \" and he told me that he will just\nadvance the rest himself), and that I could even use target cards (he was still trying to make it official by showing the p6\nof the immigration bond that you can use \"coupons\") but he also told me not to call the police because he was still trying\nto prevent them from arresting me... I am quite alone here so that's why I got scared and was ready to do anything not to\ngo to a detention center.\nWell, that's just a part of the story. Anyway, I lost a lot of money like that and maybe he stole some of my information. I\nalready did everything I could to limit the damage now and I won't get my money back but I just want to let my fellow F1\n(OPT or not) aware that 2 phone numbers that look like official phone numbers don't mean anything.\n": [

    " Changing employer when STEM OPT application is pending with USCIS\nBody of the post: Hello everyone, I wanted to share some information that might be helpful for a few of you here. I am\ncurrently on an F1 visa and have recently completed my OPT. My STEM extension application is pending with USCIS.\nDuring this time, I changed my job, and I had to go through a specific process to do so. Here's a step-by-step breakdown\nof the process:\n1. I obtained both the evaluation and final evaluation section in my I983 (last page) from my previous employer, ensuring\nthey were filled out and signed correctly. I then reported this change to my university within 10 days.\nReddit Posts\n2. I filled out and signed a new I-983 training plan with my new employer. This form was submitted to my university\nwithin 10 days of the job change. After reviewing the documents, my university issued a new I-20, which included my\nupdated employer details, along with a letter from the Designated School Official (DSO) addressed to USCIS. This letter\noutlined the change in employment and provided my new employer's information, including their E-Verify number.\n3. Following my university's instructions, I uploaded the new I-20 and the DSO letter to the evidence section of my\nUSCIS STEM application via the myuscis account.\nSatisfying I9 requirements for the new employer: \nWhen I had to show documentation for satisfying I9 requirements, I gave them a combination of my I94, receipt notice\nfor STEM application from USCIS and a copy of my expired EAD card. You can also show the authenticity of your\ndocuments by referring the \"Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) extension\" section of STEM OPT\nreceipt notice that mentions the documents that satisfy the requirements for I-9. Once I shared these with my HR, I was\ngood \nto \ngo \nwith \nmy \nI9. \nHope \nthis \nhelps. \nHere \nis \nan \nadditional \nlink \nthat \nmight \nhelp \nyou:\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/eadautoextend\nNote: When I informed my university about the employment change, they took care of updating my SEVIS portal with the\nnew employment information. However, I was still responsible for updating my personal information, such as my\naddress, within the portal.\nI hope this information helps anyone in a similar situation or who may face these circumstances in the future.\n": [

I ended up picking another class in replacement obviously but my advisor said I\nshould still contact the professor if he can manually add me to the class. I contacted him and a few days later and he\nsaid he has added me to the class and looks forward to working with me. Since I got this confirmation I dropped one\nclass cus i didn?t want to take too many classes. The class was one of those classes that starts at the last half of the\nsemester.

From my experience I'll list a few:\n \n- Work authorization:\n         This in my opinion is by far the biggest challenge F1 students face. Work authorization under F1 is aggressively\nrestricted and any violation, even unintentionally could result in immediate termination. In addition to the regural\ndifficulties just about everyone encounters in the job market, international students have extra difficulties due to the\nlimited nature of work authorization under F1. So many international students end up missing out on wonderful job\nopportunities they're qualified for simply based on their status. It can be frustrating for most international student\nbecause this is a factor out of their control. \n- Tuition Fees and cost of living:\n       A few international students are blessed enough to get fully funded scholarships or assistanships or even out of\nstate tuition waivers which helps alleviate the financial cost of their educational journey. However this isn't the case for\nmost international students who in many cases have to pay out of state tuition fees regardless of how long they've been\nReddit Posts\nin the US and are not eligible for 99% of student loan programs within the US. Some international students have found\nthemselves in situations where they've had to drop out of school for financial reasons and dropping out of school as an\ninternational student almost always means termination and potentially deportation. Due to financial hardship, many\ninternational students end up risking jeopardizing their visa status by getting a job where they get paid under the table.\n- Visa renewal:\n       In some cases, for some international students, a visit outside of the US could be a deadly mistake. There is never\na guarantee you will be able return on your student visa in the event your visa stamp is expired and you need to renew.\nA denial  of your visa is always a possibility and hence, some international students come to the US and never go back\nhome even to visit because their visa stamp has expired and they fear it will not be renewed.\nIn my opinion, so many rules surrounding the student visa need reform. I understand studying in the US is a privilege not\na right. However international students deserve better considering how much they contribute. The US has at least 24\nBillion-dollar companies that were founded by international students. Even Elon musk was once an international student.\n- ",

    " OPT Job search and unemployment days from my experience\nBody of the post: Been seeing a lot of questions here for OPT and unemployment days so thought I'd give my\nexperience/mistakes here for anyone that may find it helpful:\n1. If you do not have a confirmed job offer by the time your last semester starts, then put your OPT start date as late as\nyou can (60 days after graduation). Do not trust any companies that say \"we want you to start working as soon as\npossible\". I almost got a job offer and kept my OPT start date earlier because they wanted someone to \"start as soon as\npossible\" but they later rejected me because they changed their mind about hiring someone who needs visa\nsponsorship (even though they earlier said they were okay with visa sponsorship).\n2. Save every single unemployment day that you can. On initial OPT, you can work an as unpaid volunteer/intern for\nReddit Posts\nyour professor, non profit companies, or startups, and even be self employed. I wish I knew this early on because I\nwasted over 70 days of unemployment not knowing I could do unpaid internships/volunteer until the very end. As soon\nas you get your EAD, email your professors, or non profit organizations/startups right away for unpaid internship\nopportunities. If you can't find them, register your own LLC and be self employed. Keep in mind, if you do the above, you\ncan have a little over a year to search for paid jobson initial OPT. However, this will not work for STEM OPT.\n3. Even if you get a paid job, do not think you're safe. You can be laid off anytime, for any reason. I worked for a few\nmonths at a company and got laid off even though I was doing well. Do not trust any employer, whether it is your current\ncompany or any company you are interviewing with. You could have an amazing interview, have the right skills, be a\nhardworking person, but they can choose not to hire you at the last moment after weeks of interviewing. I spent months\ninterviewing at companies for upto 4 rounds only to be told that they changed their minds. Always be prepared and have\na backup plan.\n4. Do not trust any company that asks you to pay money for a job offer letter to stop your OPT clock, or offers \"training\nand placement\". It can cause future immigration problems.\n5. Most importantly, for evidence of unpaid/volunteering, keep the following:\n   1. Offer letter mentioning the dates, duties, weekly hours. \n   2. Employment verification letter mentioning the same.\n   3. Weekly signed time sheets. \n   4.  Weekly training plan signed by the employer. \nI wish I knew all this before, it would have saved me so much time and stress.\n": [

I then work my way from there and stick to a lower\nbound for myself (see below note how I calculate a basic lower bound). This fails in some cases sure, but try to stick to\nyour narrative. I have had decent success with this and I continue to do so. But foremost, you need to abandon your fear\nof them being upset. Getting hired is a transaction, which many people fail to realize. They need you as much as you\nneed them. Yes they pay you, but you work for them and drive their revenue. So, forget about upsetting someone and\nfocus on getting what you want, because that is what they will focus on too. \n**For how do I set my salary lower bound**\nDetermine their pay range:  They cannot offer you below the approved amounts because otherwise there are\nrepercussions to unused and approved budget (essentially they will never get that money again and they cannot lure\nbetter people with better pay). Based on the number of years of experience, work expected, hours, commute, expenses,\nand any other things which you think are related to your job, I try to come up with a monthly figure which I have to\nspend. Factor in even the tiniest expenses, even something like food (it adds up).\nLook at their pay, and see how much will you end up saving. If everything that you have to spend is more than 40% of\nyour NET salary (post tax), negotiate for higher pay. You can of course choose to be greedy and have that spend\nReddit Posts\npercentage around 25% of your post tax salary, but this is where you have to play with them to see how willing are they\nto give you what you are asking for.\nE.g. if the pay range is 75-120k per year (based on the number of years of experience of a candidate they hire), that\ngives you a monthly gross pay of 6250 to 10000 per month pre tax. Here is where you need to do a bit of math because\nyou will need to calculate how much you pay in federal and state taxes (for this amount somewhere between 18% - 33%\neffective tax rate). This gives you about 5000 - 8000 per month post tax (I have not factored in health insurance which in\nmost cases is deducted from your pre-tax income). Don't spend more than some percentage acceptable to you, and\nthen work your way from there trying to maximize the amount you have left in your bank account at the end of it.\nThis of course is not financial advise in any form, and neither am I the best planner. Take all of this with a grain of salt. If\nanyone has better ideas, feel free to write them below - would be nice to see other plans and incorporate some of those!\n- ",

    " Automatic Visa Revalidation Experience (Air + Land)\nBody of the post: I used AVR to enter the US from Canada twice, once by air and once by land, since my F1 visa had\nReddit Posts\nexpired, and thought I could share my experience since it was hard to find specifics online (I managed to dig up some of\nthe more helpful advice on some Chinese forum).\nEntry using AVR by air: I had a flight with American Airlines from Quebec City to LA with a transfer in Philadelphia.\nSeveral things to note: \n* I have received advice that it is recommended to **book with an American airline** if you are going to use your AVR,\nbecause most of the time, the agent at the check-in table will have a hard time trying to bypass the system to issue you\na boarding pass if your US visa is expired, and they will have to call their airline hotline to ask, and in my case, the\nairline hotline had to call CBP to verify, and I presume it is easier for an American airline to contact CBP.\n* \nFly \nfrom \nan \nairport \nwith \n**CBP \npre-clearance**\n([https://www.cbp.gov/travel/preclearance](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/preclearance)), \nbecause \nthe \nstaff \nthere\nsupposedly will be more familiar with the rules and will be able to streamline the process. Where I flew from (YQB) does\nnot have CBP pre-clearance and it was their first time hearing of AVR.\n* Arrive **before check-in opens** for your flight.\n* My experience: I could not check in online due to my expired visa, so I arrived at YQB 5 hours before my departure,\nexplained the situation to the agent at the check-in counter, who was perfectly willing to help, but told me to come back 2\nhours before the flight time because only then was the check-in for my flight online for them to print my boarding pass. \n   * I arrived on time and had to wait in line for 15 minutes before my turn, which left me ONE hour for them to figure out\nhow to print my boarding pass. This is the biggest mistake because I could have gained 25 more minutes, which is\nnearly 50% more time if I had arrived 10 minutes earlier.\n   * While the agent was willing to let me through, they could not figure out how to print the boarding pass with an expired\nvisa number, so they fumbled for 10 minutes and had to call their superior over. I explained the situation again to the\nboss, and the boss stood there for 10 minutes trying to help her how to bypass the system but failed, so they had to call\nthe American Airlines *hotline*, which took 20 minutes before it went through (possibly because this was in late June\nReddit Posts\nwhen travel was crazy). The American Airline agent on the other side was also apparently unfamiliar with the process,\nas both of them had to go through my I-20 line by line, starting from \"Department of Homeland Security\". The American\nAirline agent then had to connect to a CBP officer before verifying that I can *in fact* enter.\n   * After everything, they only had 5 minutes to figure out how to bypass the system and print my boarding pass, which\nof course they could not, but since the \"superior\" fortunately had the authority, they could allow some more time, so I\nfinally got my boarding pass 30 minutes before departure and got expedited through all the security checks.\n   * Entry to the States from PHL was extremely smooth. They took a brief look at my I-20 to enter my SEVIS number\nand asked where I was heading to.\n* What I would have done differently: When approaching the agent for the first time, I would explain to them that this\nwould require them to bypass the boarding pass printing process and ask if they have ever done that before. If not, if I\nspeak to their \"manager\" and if their \"manager\" also does not know how to print a boarding pass for an expired visa\nnumber, they would have ample time to figure that out with the airline. *It's only a matter of time.*\nEntry using AVR by land: I was traveling from Vancouver by the Amtrak bus, and I was mentally prepared for a very long\ncheck at the border, but the officer took a look at my I-20, asked what I did in Vancouver, where I was residing in the\nStates, entered my information and waved me through. The process took less than 5 minutes.\nSince I'm living close to the border, after those two experiences, I have started planning my travels so that I would cross\nthe border to Vancouver and travel domestically within Canada and vice versa, since the large Canadian airports with\nCBP pre-clearance are not exactly known for their efficiency.\nI hope my sharing could be helpful to some, and I would appreciate additional tips to lessen the anxiety of travelling on\nAVR ?\n": [

Should I send an email to verify what their policies around H1B is before the next\ninterview, or wait until the next rounds are over before they make an offer. \nDuring the application I selected I was allowed to work for any employer as shown in the image.

If they do jst let them know you will marry your fiance soon. 6 months In\nwork real hard and prove your worth. Then start telling stories that the relationship didnt work and you need\nsponsorship.

The status will change from ?Refused? to\n?Approved? in a few days or can even take a few weeks, depending on the case. Mine took around 4-5 weeks, this is\nlonger than most cases, mainly because I had a lot of travel history and I did my undergrad in the UK, plus my subject\nwas in the Technology Alert List (TAL).\n- ",

    " OPT Processing Delays Megathread\nBody of the post: **Welcome to the new OPT Delays Megathread**    \nPlease see the old thread [here](https://reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/kxibo0/opt_delays_help_f1_students)\n****February 26 Update****    \n>[USCIS \nhas \nannounced \nchanges \nto \nOPT \nProcessing \ndue \nto \nsignificant \ndelays \nin\nprocessing.](https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-extends-flexibilities-to-certain-applicants-filing-form-i-765-for-opt)\n> **14-month OPT Period Flexibilities**   \n> F-1 students may participate in up to 12 months of post-completion OPT, which must be completed within 14 months\nfrom the end of their program. Due to the delays at the lockbox, some applicants may only be eligible for a shortened\nperiod of OPT within that 14-month period. To allow F-1 students to complete the full period of requested OPT (up to 12\nmonths), USCIS will allow the 14-month period to commence from the date of approval of the Form I-765 for\napplications for post-completion OPT.\n> Beginning today, USCIS will approve applications for post-completion OPT with validity dates reflecting the same\namount of time originally recommended by the designated school official (DSO) from their school on the Form I-20,\nCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.\n> F-1 students requesting post-completion OPT who receive an approval of Form I-765 for less than the full amount of\nOPT time requested (not to exceed 12 months) due to the requirement that the OPT be completed within 14 months of\nthe program end date may request a correction of the EAD due to USCIS error. USCIS will issue a corrected EAD with a\nnew end date, as requested, to cover the full amount of OPT time recommended in the original application.\n>**Refiling Following Rejection**     \n> Applicants for OPT must file the Form I-765 during certain timeframes. However, we recognize that due to the lockbox\ndelays, some applicants who timely filed Form I-765 for OPT and whose applications were later rejected are unable to\nReddit Posts\ntimely refile within the required application timeframes.\n> USCIS will accept a refiled Form I-765 for OPT and STEM OPT as filed on the original filing date if:\n> \n> The original, timely filed application was received on or after Oct. 1, 2020, through May 1, 2021, inclusive; and USCIS\nsubsequently rejected it.\n> Refiled applications must be received by May 31, 2021, for USCIS to treat the application as though filed on the\noriginal received date.\n> Applicants refiling a Form I-765 for OPT or STEM OPT do not need to obtain a new Form I-20 with an updated OPT\nrecommendation from the DSO, as long as they originally submitted an application for post-completion OPT within 30\ndays of the DSO?s recommendation or an application for STEM OPT within 60 days of the DSO?s recommendation as\nrequired by the regulations.\n> Applicants refiling an application should include a copy of the rejection notice to facilitate review of the case.\n> \n>**Missing or Deficient Signatures**\n> Applications with missing or deficient signatures are generally rejected at the lockbox. This policy remains unchanged.\nHowever, if the lockbox accepts a Form I-765 application for OPT or STEM OPT with a missing or deficient signature,\nUSCIS will issue a Request for Evidence rather than deny the application, to give the applicant the opportunity to\nrespond and provide the necessary signature or correct the deficiency. We encourage applicants filing Form I-765 to\nreview the form instructions on our website to ensure their application is complete before filing it.\n> \n**January 14 Update:**    \n> OPT processing has been extremely slow this year due to COVID-19 and staffing shortages. The Dallas, TX lockbox\nhas stopped OPT processing entirely after Oct 29th applications. The Phoenix lockbox is working on late November\nReddit Posts\napplications. \n> \n> \nTo \ntrack \nthe \ncurrent \nstatus \nof \nOPTs \nin \nthe \nsystem, \nwe \nare \nusing \nthe \n[OPT\ntracker](https://opttimeline.com/#ReceiptDateData)\n> \n> If you have not yet filled your application, [USCIS has announced that all OPTs need to go to the Chicago\nlockbox](https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses?fbclid=IwAR1Po7K_XBSA1Ih0lpSPfVHrT71YZ5PrPg_x4uwW-Zt-Zw-p2\nTBHfG38nvU)\n> \n> Join the [telegram chat](http://t.me/joinchat/Sbf19jKaCzqw_2yC)\n": [

As stated before USCIS does not in any way shape or form oversee this. SEVP does.\n2.

In order for CPT to be allowed at the start of the\nprogram, it has to be a genuine requirement (meaning ALL students in a particular class or program track are required to\nhave an internship).\nHU had a large percentage of students who did not work on CPT yet they claimed it was 'required' for purposes of\nallowing day 1 cpt.

But unfortunately I was not able to contribute a lot and have done only a couple of hours of work during this 4\nmonth period (because of a death of a very close relative in my family and also because of some of my health\nconditions). \nMy main fear is that what if the Immigration officers at the airport question me regarding my work or look deeply into\nReddit Posts\nwhat I actually did for my unpaid job while in India then what kind of preparations should I do to make sure that I did at\nleast 20 hours of work per week during this time ?

(Plus, I did it without premium processing)\nAt this point, I've waited for almost 100 days, and I think changing to premium would be a waste of money. That shit\ncosts fucking more than $1000. (btw if I switch to premium, does the cost that I need to pay to deduct the original fee\nthat I paid, which is $470?)\nI already got an offer, and I told them I would be able to start in early September because I genuinely thought mine\nwould get processed in early August. They said that they were going to wait, but I'm getting scared that I might get\nthings processed in late August and will be able to start working in early October since I still need to wait for EAD.\nNormally, people say EAD gets shipped 3-4 weeks from your OPT approval date. \nI'm conflicted right now. Could you all share your experience and give me some advice? Thank you!!!!!\nReddit Posts\n": [

        "Im on a similar timeline to you. I changed to premium for the peace of mind. its around 1600 USD. it\ngets added on to the original 470, so 2k plus in total. PM me if you have specific questions and I will try my best to help.\nGoodluck my friend!\n- ",

I applied in April too but my job start date was in august and as at mid July it was stilll pending so I  applied for\nPP. I hated having to spend that much money but you have two options.

USCIS will update your start date on your EAD according to the\napproval date but they are not allowed to extend your OPT end date beyond 14 months of graduation. Therefore, if your\nOPT is approved after 2 months of your graduation you won't get an entire year of OPT.\nWhatever the premium processing fee maybe I'm quite sure you'll get the return on that with your salary of the first\nmonth itself. Also, sometimes it takes weeks to get the EAD shipped itself after it is approved because UPS fucks up\nReddit Posts\nsomewhere in the middle.\nSo better to go with premium processing and join the company as early as possible.\n- ",

They want students to pay for PP and make money so thats why they are taking way too much time.   Also, even\nfor PP, i took them 2 weeks (which they already say that a new clock starts for 30 days and they are supposed to give\nus the result) which being said, I got my approval today, 8th august.   lastly, you have to pay $1685 additionally on top of\nwhat you paid when you applied.   \nI got really tired and I waited almost 100 days before switching to PP because my employer changed my start date thrice\nReddit Posts\nfor me because they understand that ultimately, this is not our fault. \nI hope this helps!\n- ",

Here are some thoughts:\n1) Return for college (like you said you will) and DEFINITELY study a STEM related field (so quantitative econ, finance,\nmath-adjacent stuff MAY count, ask your DSO (designated school official). If you study STEM then your STEM opt\nallows you to stay 2 extra years after regular OPT (so 3 total years after college grad). This gives you 3 chances to apply\nfor H1B if you're proactive and hopefully you get it. Despite that your chances are 50/50.\nYes, H1B is brutal, some people have to pay out of pocket and it's a LOT of money.

    " F1 visa renewal while on post completion OPT. Dropbox experience\nBody of the post: While there is so little information on this topic on the internet and forums in general that I thought I\nadd my experience hoping to help someone navigating through the same pains. Before I start let me give you some\ncontext. I graduated with a PhD in December 2021, and have been working on post completion OPT for a few months\nnow. I haven't been to India (home) in a while (thanks to we all know). To add to the misery, my F1 visa expired in June\n2020, and I had no idea what the situation was regarding visa renewals.\nBy the beginning of the summer, I thought of giving it a shot and started collecting information on how the process looks\nlike. Since post completion opt comes under the category of F1 visa, the process is exactly the same as for someone\nwho is applying for F1 visa for the first time.\nThe process looks like this:\nLet's start with the pre appointments details\nReddit Posts\n1. You start with filling out the DS160 on this website ([https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/](https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/)).\n2. Once you have filled out the form, you will look for the appointments for dropbox on this website\n[https://cgifederal.secure.force.com/](https://cgifederal.secure.force.com/ - Note: I think you can no longer use this\nwebsite, it has been moved to something else). Most likely you would have forgotten the password but it's easy to\nrecover that. You will have the option of choosing dropbox if you already have a US visa. This will most likely be true if\nyou are on OPT (or any other type of visa for that matter).\n3. You need to fill out the new application for the appointment and choose the date. There will be a bunch of questions\nthat you need to answer either yes/no which will determine if you are eligible for a dropbox appointment. Once you are\ndone filling the application and paying the application fees, it will provide you the available appointments.\n4. Now here is the caveat, after listening to all the horror H1b stories I knew I had no chance of getting an appointment\nbut to my surprise the appointments for F1 dropbox are available in plenty even if you need a week from now. It took me\na few seconds to book the appointment.\n5. The documents you would need to have at the time of appointment are: **DS160 confirmation page, appointment\nconfirmation page, I20 (6 months signature), 1 photo**: please be very careful with this, a lot of people were sent back\nbecause of wrong photo specs but again they would give you the end of the day to come back and submit if you have\nmissed anything. Nothing more, nothing less.\n6. Some points to remember; even if you make a mistake on your DS160, don't panic. It's totally okay to fill out a new\nform and take a print out of it on the day of your appointment and submit it with your documents. Just let them know that\nyou had made a mistake in your submitted DS160.\nDay of appointment:\n1. I had my appointment at the Delhi VAC which is next to Shivaji metro station. My appointment was on Wednesday at\n1:15 PM but I went there at 10 AM. They will ask you the appointment time and chances are they will ask you to come\nReddit Posts\nback 20 mins before the actual time. You can always lie to them which is what I did. I told them that my appointment was\nat 1030. They won't check your confirmation page.\n2. Once you are in, you can go to the counter and submit the documents. Since the person who was collecting the\ndocument did not know about post completion OPT, she had to go back and check with her senior officials. Don't\nhesitate to explain your position if they don't have any information on it.\n3. I did not see any update on my application before Monday (you can check the status here:\n[https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx)).\n4. On Monday, my application status changed from \"no status\" to \"application received\" and also had a note to check\nback in 2 business days for a decision on my application. On Tuesday, my visa got approved and I got my passport in 3\nbusiness days.\nThe whole process took 9 business days (1 holiday in between), so keep the time frame in mind with some buffer days.\nI had a lot of anxiety throughout the whole process but it was pretty straight forward. I had all the worst scenarios in my\nhead just in case I had to stay here for a few months.\nPlease feel free to DM me. I know it can be extremely challenging to go through this!\nPLEASE PLEASE go ahead and book your appointments, I was too scared since it's recommended not to go back when\nyou are on OPT. Amongst my friends, I have not heard a single case of rejection and that's the same thing that the DSO\ntold me as well but again that's a very small sample size.\nEdit: I have received so many messages that I want to add this. Don?t worry about it. Visa renewals will be a part of your\nlife if you are planning to stay in the US longterm. Don?t plan your life around it if you want to keep your sanity in check.\nReddit Posts\nGo home and enjoy. Most likely you will get the visa and even if you don?t, you will be stuck there for few months and\nisn?t that the best thing if you can obviously afford it!\n": [

    " URGENT: F-1 VISA Renewal got REFUSED while on STEM OPT - Applied through D\nBody of the post:  \nHi Folks - I graduated with my bachelor's in 2022, and I am on STEM OPT (valid through July 2025). I currently work for\na SEVIS registered employer (have been with them since my internship in 2021). My F-1 visa expired in July 2022, so I\ncame to India (my home country) to renew it.

They only took my I-20 and photo; this is probably where it went wrong as they didn't take my\nEAD card or proof of employment even though I insisted multiple times. My status changed to REFUSED today (March\n26th), 10 business days after my drop-off appointment date. I have not received any email from the consulate so far, nor\nReddit Posts\ndo I have my passport, so I don't know on what grounds they refused my visa. If anyone has gone through a similar\nexperience recently, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I am freaking out as I was supposed to fly back on 30th morning.

    " F1 visa approved with I-140 approved as well. \nBody of the post:   \nThe following information is intended to only help other people who could have been in a similar situation to me. I knew\nat the time I would have benefited a lot from a post like this, especially when the majority of the information out there is\nvery vague and there is not a straightforward answer.\nReddit Posts\nTo put things in perspective. I have been in the US for almost 11 years. All this time, I have been on a F1 visa. About a\nyear ago I decided to apply for the green card through the NIW program. During the application, I  \ndecided that I will go through Consular process, because I refused to be stock in the US. Additionally, there was a\npersonal motive as well. \nA few months forward, my I-140 got approved and I decided to do my first trip out of the US with and I-140 approved.\nWhen I returned, I had no issues entering, and so far I have entering 6 times and in those time I never got questioned.\nUp to this point, this information is kind of well known. There have been a lot of people sharing similar experience as\nmine. However, here is where the situation gets a little bit complicated. Remember that, when the NIW application was\nfiled I chose to do Consular process because of personal  \nmotive. Well, the thing I never wanted to happened it happened and I had to leave the US. To make matters worse I had\nonly one week left on my F1 Visa. \nWhen I was leaving the US, I tried searching online for any potential cases of people renewing their F1 visa with an\nI-140 application approved. Everywhere I looked, all the information was the same. Applying for an F1 with and I-140\napproved will most likely lead to denial due to the immigrant intent. I also asked the lawyers I used for my NIW\napplication, and this was their answer. \n***?The officer will not grant your F-1 visa if they believe you have the settled intention to file form I-485. The burden of\nproof is on you to show that you do not intend to file form I-485 inside the US.***\n***An approved I-140 can be seen as evidence of one's intent to file form I-485 inside the US. In order to approve your\nF-1 visa, an officer needs to be convinced that your plan is to leave the US at some point to do IVP.?***\nReddit Posts\nAlthough all the information I found was negative, I still decided to leave. Because for me it was more important to be\nwhere I needed to be at that time, than any green card or F1 visa. While I was abroad, my visa expired, and I had to\nre-apply for a new one. During the interview the office did not asked anything related to my I-140 application ( I did\ndisclose it on my visa application). During the application I was informed that I will be placed in the administration\nprocess. This procedure lasted 4 months and a half, but at the end my visa was approved I returned to the US about a\nweek ago.\nAnyways, I hope this story helps anyone to have a little hope in case you face a situation like what I had to face. I know\nthat for me it would have been good to read a story like this at the time. Also please take this information as what it is, a\nstory. As someone that decided to go through an experiment that not many people are willing to go through due to the\nhigh risk it presents. Always discuss with your lawyer your specific situation, but if it happens that life put you and rough\nspot you could use this story to grab some hope that everything may be ok.\n": [

My visa status changed from \"approved\" to\n\"issued\" this evening. This is my third F-1 visa and it was never issued this quickly before.\nI did my undergrad in the US, worked under OPT afterwards (did not attempt to renew visa then), started my PhD,\nReddit Posts\nrenewed my visa after my first semester and I am now on post-completion OPT. I applied for STEM OPT extension right\nbefore having to travel abroad (with premium processing) and it got approved a few days before my visa interview (took\na total of \\~10 days). The officer didn't really ask me about it, though, he just asked my purpose of travel and what I did\nfor work. Last time I was given a yellow slip and was put on administrative processing, I think, which took about 3 weeks.\nI thought I would experience something similar since my field is adjacent to multiple fields on the TAL (technology alert\nlist), but everything went super smoothly with no administrative processing this time.\nIf you are currently traveling on OPT, have to renew your visa and are stressing out about it, here is one positive\nexample.

SEVP will address the issues with the following initiatives:\n1. An hour-long maintenance outage on Thursday, April 18, 2024, from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nEDT. During this time the SEVP Portal will NOT be available. Any changes to Student and\nExchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) student records will upload to the SEVP Portal\nonce the portal is back online.

(DSOs?) inability to generate temporary passwords for\nstudent portal password resets.\n? Students? inability to log in to the SEVP Portal.\nNOTE: Like the March outage, when students log in to the SEVP Portal for the first time after\nthe system update, they will need to change their password. There will be a notification on the\nSEVP Portal Sign In page explaining the outage and password reset requirement for students.\n2. A rolling, backend SEVIS Portal data resynchronization effort that should not impact portal users.\nStudents should see correct information in their portal accounts by Monday, April 29, 2024. This\neffort will address the following issues:\n? SEVP Portal inability to authenticate users.\nReddit Posts\n? The portal displaying a generic ?error? message when students try to update their portal account information.\n? The portal sending erroneous missed portal validation and reporting emails.\n?

This is to put it out there that I got my F1 visa in the second half of July, 2023, after my visa\ndenial in India in the year 2022.\nIt was quite hard to get visa slots for previously refused in the months of June/July in India, so I was willing to risk it and\ngo to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) and give it a shot.\nMy visa interview experience:\nOfficer: Hi there!\nMe: Good afternoon officer! Here are my documents.\nOfficer: Why US?\nMe: I am going to pursue Ph.D. in Computer Science at UT Dallas.\nOfficer: Do you already have a Masters?\nMe: Yes officer, I have a Masters in Computer Science from xxx in Delhi. \nOfficer: Oh Delhi! (Typing) So why UT Dallas?\nReddit Posts\nMe: Well, I would like to research in the fields of misinformation and hate speech. There are two great professors, Prof.\nX and Prof. Y who are doing interesting projects in these fields.\nOfficer: Y? Is that her first name? \nMe: Yes officer, I didn't know how to pronounce her last name which is Z, and I didn't want to mispronounce it.\nOfficer: Can you tell me about your Masters Thesis?\nMe: So I worked on XX project which is on various NLP tasks on tweets. It could be sentiment, humor, parts of speech\netc. So given a tweet, my algorithm could classify the tweets into a set number of categories that can further be used to\nstudy the tweets better and take proactive actions on inappropriate tweets.\nOfficer: Oh, that's great, quite interesting!

It is fully funded by the university as I have got a graduate teaching assistantship offer from UT Dallas.\nOfficer: (Typing for 45-60 seconds, I thought that's it) So I see you have applied for a Master's course previously, why\ndid you change your course? (I applied MS CS in 2022 and got refused)\nMe: Well, I wanted to research further in the field of Computer Science. After I was refused last year, I reconsidered my\noptions, and since I already had a Masters, a PhD program objective adds more value to my research interests. \nOfficer: Makes sense.

It felt like a regular interview that I\nwould have given in the Indian US Consulate. In fact there were four other Indians I could spot during my slot! (With the\npassports they were holding)\nTips and steps for visa application and getting your passport back:\n\\- There is no online payment for MRV fee. You need someone physically go to a Vietnam post office to make the\npayment on your visa application number (They just need one page prinout of application number and your passport Bio\npage printout). \n\\- You just need your passport, DS160, and i20 to attend the interview. The rest are just supporting documents that you\nintend to carry. \n\\- Vietnam does not discriminate appointment slots for residents and non-residents. (Singapore and Thailand US\nConsulates do) So you get earlier dates\nReddit Posts\n\\- I attended my interview in Ho Chi Minh and everything was smooth. I believe Hanoi should only be better since it is a\nbigger one. \n\\- You can opt for premium delivery of passport to your hotel address which should be quick (I hope as claimed on their\nwebsite). I opted for pick up and it took two more days after the US consulate dispatched my passport. Also if you are\nopting for pick-up, you will get an email with the airway bill number. Once you get that email, just give a shot at the\npassport pick-up center (of that post office) since their website does not update the current status of the parcel correctly.\nI luckily got mine when I went there at 4 pm that evening, so I could leave the same night. \n\\- Rest you can check out places in Ho Chi Minh when you are around there, you have to just wait it out till you get your\npassport. You can't leave the country without your passport :P \n\\- Grab is a good app for taxi and food delivery. Currency exchange rates are good enough in the airport so you can\nchange everything needed there. \n&#x200B;\n&#x200B;\n": [

But tax obligations are different. Both Turbo Tax and HR block are generally NOT for\nnon-residents. They almost exclusively process resident taxes and all estimates are based off of tax residency. So as a\nnon-resident for tax purposes, you will never get a valid estimate there.  Non-residents pay fewer taxes and are eligible\nfor fewer refunds as a result. So the number you enter will be with fewer taxes and they then Turbo Tax and HR block\nadd the greater discount. Also, there is NO difference between programs or software in what taxes you get.

I\nReddit Posts\ngraduated my bachelor's degree in Poland on 26th of April 2024. Here is how was my interview was: \nME: Good Morning\nVO:   Good Morning, Please give me your I-20 and passport\nME: Here you are\nVO: Where are you going?\nME: San Francisco city, California state in the USA to pursue my master's degree of Information Technology. \nVO: Who is funding your education?\nME: My father is funding my education and all my living expenses.\nVO: What he does? \nME: He is in Oil and Gas industry, currently he owns two gas stations in my home country. \nVO: Retail gas station ?\nME: Yes\nVO: Sorry, I can not issue your visa.\nReddit Posts\nand this is how he rejected me in terms of case 214(b), all the time he was looking in his computer and typing\nsomething. I really do not know what went wrong, I can surely say that I am a legin student who wants a master's degree\ndiploma from the USA, I had a lot of docs apart from I-20 which he did not ask even. Can someone please give some\nsuggestions or and advise for my next interview?\n": [
        "Was there any false information you gave? Or something the was written but does not match with what\nyou said? Seems very odd to deny.\nUnder 214 section B, the applicant was unable to show that their intended activities in the United States are consistent\nwith the classification of the nonimmigrant visa they applied for. \nThink of the document that was provided, does it match with what you said? Did you provide your father?s financial\ndocuments? Was there anything that was falsely presented?\n- ",

        "Would recommend you to correct visa spelling before people start attacking you that ?its because of\nthat?\n- ",
        "Your visa interview was a mere formality, you were rejected based on some issues in your profile\nbased on what you have indicated in the DS160.\n- ",
        "Another note, it?s always a good idea to give your best answer in the very first question they ask and\nprove that 1. You are a credible student, 2. You have sufficient funding, 3. Will return back to your country after studying.\nSo this is how I would recommend answer the ?Where are you going question?.\nReddit Posts\nAnswer: ?I have been admitted to study an MS Information Technology at Carlifonia State and I would like to attend the\nschool this fall. My father will be funding my education as he owns 2 gas stations here in Poland and makes X amount of\nmoney annually. Upon completion of my studies, I plan to come back and help him to scale the new information\ntechnology tools that I will acquire in my degree to assist my father?s business to be more competitive in the 4th\nIndustrial Revolution?. (I just made this up but you get the point).\nThis answer proves all the 3 requirements that they need to verify when interviewing you for an F1 because you?ve\nproven that you?re a credible student, you have sufficient funding & plan to return back to your home country after\ncompleting your studies. It?s always advised to answer the very first question this way and not ?leave it to chance?,\nessentially making the visa officers job easier to issue you the visa. It?s unlikely that one is rejected solely based on the\nlast question, the decision was probably already made way before, i.e the first few answers.\n- ",

The rest is up to you and how you\nsell/present yourself. Work on answering questions you think might come. Also work on turning your negatives into\npositives (for example, if the interviewer asks about what you think your weaknesses are and you say your weakness is\nthat you often take your work home.

    " on f1 visa on OPT, never filed taxes throughout college\nBody of the post: Hi! So, I bumped into the 'Taxes Megathread' and learned that I should've been filing taxes ever since,\nbut I never did. I'm honestly not sure how rare this situation is and if anybody has experienced this and could possibly\ngive me some advice. I also worked on campus part-time.

I am always amazed when students remember to do them, and\nnever surprised when they forget. :) It's definitely not *great* that you never filed them, but it's not the worst thing you\ncould ever do. Especially if you were making a relatively small amount of money just working on campus! You can\ndefinitely post-file (usually called backfile) taxes and get them all in now. Depending on what you owe/are owed, you\nmay have to pay a penalty. After you have done that, I would say try not to worry about it - that's really and truly all you\ncan do. Timely tax filing can be a factor in later immigration stuff (like a PR application), but I do think documenting that\nyou \"tried your best\" counts for something. \nI am not too familiar with Sprintax so it might be possible to do through there, but tbh, if you can afford it I would highly\nrecommend you hire a tax preparer for this year to help you with the backfiling rather than trying to do it on your own.\nJust make sure you specifically find a tax preparer who specializes in nonresident alien taxes so they file the right forms\nfor you - a lot of tax prepares are NOT aware of this difference and will, for example, file Form 1040 instead of 1040-NR.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

It was obvious that they probably don't get cases like mine too often, so they were almost\n\"navigating\" it as we go along, at least that's what it looked like to me. Anyway, my advice is to not go empty handed to\nh&r block. I'm not earning more than 50k, so paying 200 to file my 2020's taxes and 500 more to back file from 2017 was\ndefinitely hefty.

I had so much fear in filing my\ntaxes wrong so I went to a fairly reputable (or commonly heard) group, but also learned that some preparers can also do\nit correctly with less than that sum.\nHere's just my little experience. Go see for yourself. (Hopefully, share yours too.)\n- ",

Still should file taxes, though.\nHowever, if you were a non-resident alien, then you may have some tax penalty  because of higher tax rate- but it is\ndefinitely fixable. What you need to do ASAP is to contact a department that handles international students' tax and see\nif they can help backfile your taxes.

        "The chances are very good that everything will turn out fine. One can try to hide a status violation.\nHowever, there is also a lot of merit in admitting the mistake and then making a good faith effort with the U.S.\ngovernment to correct it. It shows the U.S. government that you know you made an error and that you are willing to\nmake an honest effort with them to correct that.\nThe other option is to try to hide from the government that you violated your status with them and hope they never find\nout. And if they do, which looks better?\nReddit Posts\n1. \"Yes, I did it, and then I took action to correct it?\"\nor\n2) \"I violated my status (which you only know because you found it), and I tried to hide it from you (government)?\"\nIf I were a USCIS adjudicator, I know upon which one I would look more favorably.\nIf you take action to regain your F-1 status in a timely manner, it is very unlikely to have negative consequences in the\nfuture for you or any family member.\nI've seen many students successfully doing what you're planning to do which is to obtain a new SEVIS record, pay the\nSEVIS fee again, and then re-enter the U.S. using the valid F-1 visa to reset the new F-1 status. That includes by travel\nto Mexico. Any time you are a non-immigrant to the U.S., there is always some level of risk that  you will not be allowed\nto re-enter any time you choose to travel outside the U.S. However, if you have all of your documents in order, there is a\nlow risk of being denied re-entry.\nThe biggest implications that come with that plan is that you won't be eligible for CPT or OPT unless and until you\ncomplete one full academic year of study after having returned to the U.S. on the new SEVIS record. That means if\nreturning and needing less than one full academic year to complete your current I-20 program of study, you won't be\neligible for CPT or OPT for that degree. The other is needing to pay again the (currently) $350 SEVIS fee.\nNothing about this situation would invalidate eligibility to apply for an I-20 extension, but it also isn't a reason alone to do\nan I-20 extension. The U.S. government requires by federal regulation that your university be able to cite a compelling\nacademic or medical reason why you are not able to complete your study in your I-20 program by your current I-20 end\nReddit Posts\ndate, and then why you need then the additional time to meet those requirements. Whether or not you meet that\nrequirement is very specific to your own, individual degree progress, your own degree program's academic\nprogram/curriculum, and your own DSO's interpretation of what what meets the requirements for citing a compelling\nmedical or academic reason. For all those reasons, whether or not you would be eligible for an I-20 extension is fully a\ndiscussion to be had with your academic advisor and DSO.\n- ",

Since I was very new to the US at the time, I freaked out and wanted to get back home to get myself checked out. \n \nI apprised the school of this development and they offered me a deferral to June 2024. And I took a return flight out of\nthe US on the 14th of June without starting the course but I did use my F1 visa to enter the United States.   \nA few days later, the immigration office of the college informed me that since I had used the F1 visa to enter US, they\nwere left with no option but to terminate my SEVIS record. They did say that the reason for termination will not be\nnegative. And hopefully as I understand, I have not accrued any unlawful presence in the US since I left much before\nthey terminated my SEVIS record.   \nThe school also said that they would be happy to help me with a new I20 for next year.   \nHaving said this, I wanted to understand if I would have difficulty in getting a VISA issued to me next year?

It let's an employer know if you may need to sponsored and it helps them select\nthe appropriate candidate. For example, most jobs in my office do not qualify for H1B. Therefore anyone who indicates\nthey need sponsorship won't be considered because we CANNOT offer sponsorship in any way shape or form. It is\nimpossible for the positions to meet the requirements for visa sponsorship. \nAnother way to think about the questiob is this: what is your time worth? You go work for a company on OPT/STEM\nOPT only for the position to not be eligible for H1B or possibly the company is not large enough to pay for all the\nrequirements for H1B or for another reason cannot meet H1B requirements. You essentially wasted your OPT time with\nthat company with no longer term options for you. \nReddit Posts\nThose are the two sides, it let's a company who otherwise cannot sponsor you know that they can't select you as it\nbenefits no one in the long term and it allows you to get offer with a company who knows that you will need sponsorship\nin the future and is potentially willing to do that. \nTo the poster who said it is discriminatory, it is not as employers can ask questions about your legal employment status\nin the US and it was settled over a decade ago in the courts. \nIf you lie on your job application a company can fire you for cause. Meaning you can lose access to benefits (like vested\nshares in a company, Healthcare benefits after being fired, and no access to unemployment).  The only time to answer\nno is it you honestly have no plans to stay in the US. \nWill selecting yes prevent you from being selected for jobs? Yes. Will it prevent you from being hired by a company\notherwise eligible and willing to sponsor? No.\n- ",

    " Automatic Visa Revalidation (AVR) Experience: Traveling to Canada by Bus and R\nBody of the post:  This isn't my personal experience, but I asked a friend to share his story, as this community could\nbenefit from more AVR data points. \nReddit Posts\n\"Hi Friends,\nI'm currently in the US under F1 status and have an up-to-date I-20 document. Back in 2022, I changed my status from a\nJ1 to an F1 visa. I traveled from the US to Canada via Detroit by bus, aiming to be a tourist and to obtain a work permit.\nAt the Canadian border, the customs officer asked me questions like, \"Why are you going to Canada? Which country do\nyou live in? What's your status in the US? Where are you heading in Canada?\" I gave short and clear answers. The\nofficer wished me a good time, wrapping up the conversation in about 2-3 minutes, and then I entered Canada.\nI stayed in Canada for a total of 18 days and didn't travel to any other country during this period. After that, I returned to\nthe US using Automatic Visa Revalidation (AVR) from Toronto YYZ Airport. My flight was with United Airlines. When I\nwent to check in and get my boarding pass, an agent noticed I didn't have a current visa in my passport. I explained that\nI'm a student under F1 status and showed my I-20 and original F1 status change approval documents. The agent called\nsomeone for verification and then issued my boarding pass. This whole process took about 4 minutes.\nNext, I proceeded to the main section, where the US customs officers were for passport and visa control. I repeated the\nsame information to the US customs officers. They asked, \"How many days did you stay in Canada? Did you travel to\nany other country from Canada? Where do you live in the US? Are you a student?\" I answered these questions and\nprovided my fingerprints. After taking my fingerprints, the officer took my photo with a camera beside him, returned my\ndocuments, and allowed me to pass through. This conversation lasted about 6-7 minutes.\nAfter landing in the US, nobody asked me anything further, and I just walked straight out of the airport through the exit.\nIn conclusion, I can say that you can travel with peace of mind using AVR, provided you stay for a maximum of 30 days.\nBeing always prepared and keeping your necessary documents in order is very important.\nReddit Posts\nInterestingly, they didn't stamp any entry or exit seals on my passport. However, when I checked online, I saw that my\nI-94 document had been updated, and my status was updated as F1 on I-94.\nTake care.\"\n": [

I am about to travel and re enter the\nUS with AVR for third time, my F1 is expired while on STEM OPT, valid i20 untill 2025.\n- ",

    " Urgent: STEM OPT Denied because degree is not considered STEM?!\nBody of the post: My gf got her denial notice today. She got her MBA degree with STEM (Management Science)\nconcentration from an ivy-league school. Her program receives STEM designation and seems like this is a new issue\nReddit Posts\nthese business schools start to face since her DSO said there are more cases like this happening in peer schools. She\nseems to be the first case to receive a denial as the school said they need some time to discuss the best course of\naction. Below is her denial details.\n*At the time the DSO recommends a 24-month OPT extension under this paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) in SEVIS, the degree\nthat is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be contained within a category on the STEM \\[Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics\\] Designated Degree Program List.*\n*A review of your application and supporting documents submitted, as well as the Student and Exchange Visitor\nInformation System (SEVIS), indicates that the degree program you completed in Business Administration is not listed\non the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List. According to the evidence you submitted, your degree of Business\nAdministration was issued in conjunction with your concentration in Management Science.*\n*Per 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(2)(iii), ?the degree that is the basis for the application for the OPT extension must be\ncontained within a category on the STEM Designated Degree Program List.? Any ancillary minors, concentrations or\ncertificates earned with the degree cannot be considered as completing a STEM degree program when the degree itself\nis not a STEM designated degree. DHS provides further clarification in the Federal Register Notice. According to The\nUpdate to the Department of Homeland Security STEM Designated Degree Program List, 87 FR 3317 (January 21,\n2022), only qualifying majors may meet the requirements for STEM extensions: ?In 2016, DHS published a Final Rule\nproviding a 24-month extension of OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students who majored in a designated STEM field of\nstudy. See 81 FR 13039 (Mar. 11, 2016).?*\n*To qualify for the optional practical training (OPT) STEM extension, the degree that is the basis for the extension must\nbe a bachelor?s, master?s or doctoral degree that is assigned a Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code that\nappears on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List. A concentration in Management Science, though it may\nReddit Posts\nhave a STEM CIP code assigned, cannot be used to qualify for a STEM extension. The acceptable STEM CIP code\nmust be assigned to the student?s primary or secondary major.*\n*Your diploma/transcript shows you were granted a Master of Business Administration. Your SEVIS record shows a CIP\ncode of 52.1301 - Management Science which does not match the conferred degree. The CIP code of 52.1301 -\nManagement Science is actually the CIP code that corresponds with the concentration portion of the academic\nprogram.*\n*As your record does not reflect an approved STEM degree on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List, you\nare ineligible for employment authorization under 8 CFR \u00a7 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(C).*\n*Your Form I-765 is denied.*\n*This decision is without prejudice to consideration of subsequent applications for employment authorization filed with\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services.*\n*This decision may not be appealed. However, if you disagree with this decision, or if you have additional evidence that\nshows this decision is incorrect, you may submit a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider by completing a Form\nI-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion. A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be considered and must be\nsupported by affidavits or other new documentary evidence. A motion to reconsider must show that the decision was\nlegally incorrect according to statute, regulation, and/or precedent decision.*\n*The motion must be filed within 33 days from the date of this notice.*\nBoth the school and her company said this is absurd, but no one seems to know what to do because this is a rare case.\nReddit Posts\nI don't understand how other students receive approval with the same degree from same program and faced no issue.\nCan anyone please help on this? Any recommendation for Immigration lawyer?? What are the chances that she submit\na motion to reopen and she will get an approval? What are the additional evidence the school can provide??

Having internship experiences doesn't mean much\nbecause interns were not meant to do much in a job.

Nevertheless, they make it exactly as anybody else. If they do it, why can't you do it? I think that getting\na PhD to have the chance to live in a country that you love is a more than valid reason. In my very personal experience,\nwhen speaking about research, there is very little to romanticize. It is a 100% a business, and PhD students are just\nturds sitting on the lower step of the chicken coop ladder. If you decide to go for a PhD, it will be hard, you will probably\nhate it (or part of it), but you will probably make it, and that will make things much easier immigration wise.

I managed to land an internship at a great company which was\nsupposed to last 3 months. I?ve been giving it my all, but instead of offering me a full-time position, they ended up\nextending my internship. As this extension period draws to a close, I have a feeling they might extend it again because\nthey know the job market is tough, and I won't have many options. I'm living in NYC, and the intern salary makes it really\nhard to get by. Plus, I missed this year's H1B lottery because I was still an intern.\nOn the other hand, I've received an offer from a large company in San Diego for a contractual role that lasts a year. The\npay is significantly higher than my current internship, which would really help with my financial situation. However, it's a\ncontractual role through a staffing company, and I?m not sure if I?ll be able to apply for an H1B with this position.\nMissing another year of the H1B lottery isn't something I can afford.\nI'm mentally exhausted from the uncertainty and financial strain of my current situation. I need to decide soon, and I'm\ntorn between the stability and potential full-time opportunity of my current internship versus the better pay and new\nopportunity in San Diego, but with the risk of the contractual nature and H1B complications.\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on what I should do? Any insights on how staffing companies\nReddit Posts\nhandle H1B sponsorship would also be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance for your help!\n": [

        "Stay in NYC\n- ",
        "Usually staffing companies do sponsor visas, ask them if that it possible. If yes, take that off position. \nFor the internship, explain your situation to your manager in a one-on-one. The fact that they extended your internship\nimplies that they are interested in keeping you. Explain your situation and tell them you need sponsorship. If they say no,\ni would recommend taking the contract work, earn more, save up and really grind to secure a fulltime position\n- ",
        "Talk to your Manager at the current internship and see if they are looking to sponsor you after you?ve\ncompleted this term. If not then take the CA job.\n- ",
        "Regarding the San Diego role:  \nAsk the staffing company if they will apply for your H1B as a lot of them do that. That could also act as a test to see if\nthey do things properly or are shady. They might mention things like you paying for your H1B while they apply for it,\nwhich is illegal.  \n  \nI am currently based out of San Diego and I am not sure which industry you are in but San Diego is not the best place to\nbe at if you are in the tech sector, especially if you would be looking for jobs. The city is beautiful and laid back but not a\nlot of tech companies here. However, if you are in defense etc, you should be fine.\nRegarding the NYC role:  \nReddit Posts\nTalk to your manager and tell him that given your visa situation, you would like to have some stability in terms of your\nwork and an internship doesn't provide that. Ask him what the company's plan is for you and based on how honest you\nare with your manager and how genuine they are, you can even mention that you have the SD role and would switch if\nthings aren't looking too good at your current company. They extended your internship that means they like your work,\nso if they really want you, they should extend a full time offer.\n- ",
        "When you are in this hesitation, please clear it. Talk with your boss or HR head sharing your concerns.\nI'm sure many employers are aware of the difficulties of international students. If they openly tell you that they can't\nsponsor it's high time that you need to speed up your job search to find a sponsor. \nTalk with staffing agencies, they also sponsor while you work on a contractual role for them.\n- ",
        "H1B take priority over everything else if you don?t have any other visa to work on. \nQuestions for you:\n1. Can staffing company sponsor you?\n2. Can the hiring company extend your employment after a year? \n3. If they can?t extend, will the staffing company keep you on payroll and give you another contract? Most staffing\ncompanies do that and even file for H1B.\n4. Will you get full time offer from your current employer? \n5. If yes, when? Because you don?t wanna waste another year for H1B. \nEmployers see interns and employers differently.\nReddit Posts\nIMO, your chances of getting H1B in San Diego is higher than being in nyc.\n"

Graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology and went\non to do a master... because a direct entry into licensed psychology is excruciatingly competitive. I started my master's\nin Fall 2021 after graduation - and my visa was due to expire in May 2022. Due to COVID-19 - the US had closed\nborders with my country in the Summer of 2021 and I did not want to risk coming home. In Summer 2022 and Summer\n2023 I had to take in-person classes and only had a short 18-day interim break between the semesters. I graduated in\nJuly 2023 with my master's degree and started my PhD in a licensed psychology program (not going to specify the\ndetails for anonymity over Reddit). I graduated in late July 2023 with my MA and MS and started my PhD shortly on\nAugust 15th. I did not have to do a transfer form because I got into a different program in the same institution - so just a\nchange of education level. I had to make a transfer request when I moved from my undergraduate institution to my\nmaster's institution. All this while being on a valid I-20 and maintaining my student status, DSO whom I am in close\ncontact recommended I do not go home unless I have a burning desire to visit my family (which I do - but I also value my\nReddit Posts\neducation.

And I created a ticket on SEVP portal help regarding login issues as well. Everything seemed normal.\nUntil today, at 5 pm I received an email from SEVP response center in response to my ticket. The email says that upon\nreview of my record, my SEVIS record is showing in terminated status and it says that I would no longer be participating\nin Post completion OPT. I am absolutely freaking out. I followed all the rules. Why would my SEVIS get terminated? It\njust doesn't make sense. My DSO just sent me a new I-20.

I can probably start in August/September. I wanted to travel back to my home country after\ngraduation. But my immigration advisor told me that even if I have all the documents, including the EAD card, it is not\nadvisable to leave US during OPT. Can I get some insights as I really want to go home before I start my job. \nReddit Posts\n": [
        "Copying my response from 5 days ago when this same question was posted here:\nYour DSO is just advising conservatively. \nIt's important to remember that F-1 status is a non-immigrant status. As a non-immigrant, you are never guaranteed\nentry into the US. This means every time you choose to travel outside the US, there is always some risk you will not be\nallowed to re-enter.\nChoosing to travel then becomes a matter of risk assessment and risk management. It is then not a yes or no answer\nyour DSO can always give you. Your DSO is advising cautiously related to those risks. \nThe list of items you mention you plan to have is the same as what the US government provides you should have to\nrequest to re-enter the US once your classes have ended and your OPT has been approved. Have your EAD and your\njob offer available to show if asked for if requesting to re-enter the US once your study has ended and your OPT is\napproved.\nThere are times when risk to re-entry is lower and times when it is higher. In the middle of your degree returning to\ncontinue study with a valid I-20, travel signature, and valid F-1 visa is a lower level risk. Traveling when you need to get\na new F-1 visa before coming back is something that increases risk. Traveling once you've finished study, your OPT is\napproved, but you have no job offer is much higher risk. Traveling with a pending OPT application after study has ended\nis a little higher risk. \nReddit and even a DSO can never guarantee you trouble free re-entry. People can get denied for some rather\nunexpected and random reasons. Be careful about what you have on your phone/electronics. There are stories of\nReddit Posts\nstudents getting denied entry because of information CBP found on their phones as part of secondary inspection.\nInstances of them finding evidence of unauthorized employment, drug use, or academic dishonesty are all things that\nhave caused a small number of those requesting F-1 entry to be denied. These are all things that a DSO advising you is\nalmost certainly not going to be aware of. \nBe aware of the requirements (which it sounds as though you are). Decide what level of risk upon re-entry request you\nare comfortable with related to how much you really want to travel. Make your decisions.\n- ",

    " STEM OPT Extension Denied - SEVIS record does not match the conferred degree\nBody of the post: Hello all, new to here, just got the notice of denial today and am currently in a panic...\n**Timeline: Year-1 OPT started in July 2022; Submitted STEM OPT in June 2023; Added Premium Processing in early\nNovember; RFE in late November; Responded to RFE within a week; Notice of Denial today.**\nReason for RFE:  \nThe evidence you have provided is not sufficient to establish that you have graduated with a STEM degree from XXX\nUniversity. The most recent I-20 and your SEVIS record list your CIP code as 45.0603 - Econometrics and Quantitative\nEconomics. **However, a review of the documentary evidence you submitted indicates that you completed Master of\nArts in International Economics and Finance, which is not listed on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List.**\nThe evidence you have submitted does not show how your degree relates to the CIP code listed on your I-20 and in\nSEVIS.\nReddit Posts\nMy response (letter provided by the school official):  \nPlease accept this correspondence as confirmation that XXX successfully completed al requirements for the Master of\nArts in International Economics and Finance at XXX. XXX matriculated in July, 2021, and was officially conferred the\nMaster of Arts in International Economics and Finance on June 17, 2022.  \n**The Master of Arts in International Economics and Finance is a STEM-designated program with the CIP code of\n45.0603 - Econometrics and Quantitative Economics.**\nThe Notice of Denial that came in today apparently is not satisfied with the school's response:  \n... the degree that is the basis for the extension must be a bachelor?s, master?s or doctoral degree that is assigned a\nClassification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code that appears on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List.  \n**The acceptable STEM CIP code must be assigned to the student?s primary or secondary major.** Your\ndiploma/transcript shows you were granted a Master of Arts in International Economics and Finance. Your SEVIS record\nshows a CIP code of 45.0603 - Econometrics and Quantitative Economics **which does not match the conferred\ndegree.** As your SEVIS record does not reflect an approved STEM degree on the DHS STEM Designated Degree\nProgram List, you are ineligible for employment authorization.\nI really need some help here to understand the situation as my school officials are as clueless as I am:\n1. **Do I have a chance for a Motion To Reopen?** If so, what documents should I be providing (asking the school to\nprovide)?\n2. Since my year-1 OPT expired back in July, **am I able to legally stay in the US while they process my MTR?** While\nthe Notice of Denial does not explicitly say I need to leave within XX days, I searched online and there seems to be a\nmixture of interpretations on when the grace period (60 days) start counting.\n3. I understand that from the day I receive this notice, I won't be able to work anymore. How should I be talking to my\nemployer? Asking for Leave of Absence (LOA)? I still have 2-3 weeks left of PTO. **May I use PTOs during this period\nReddit Posts\n(while I file for MTR)?**\nThank you in advance for your time and help.\n": [

I applied for a job listed as on campus student position offered by\nmy university a while ago. I didn't think too much about it when I applied, because 1. my school's international students\ncenter's website said that on campus employment does not require authorization for f1 students and 2. the job was\nposted by the university and listed as on campus, part time, student position. Maybe I should've been more cautious, but\nI feel like it's reasonable to believe a job posted by the university that's listed as on campus, is actually on campus,\nwhich is why I didn't double-check with my schools international center before applying or accepting the offer.\nDuring the interview and application process, i was asked whether I'm eligible to work in the US, and I said yes as I was\nunder the impression that it's an on campus job and my schools international center said f1 students can do on campus\njobs without prior authorization. \nI got accepted for the position and already signed the offer letter.

After accepting the offer letter, I wanted to know more about the department ill be working for. But as I\nresearch deeper about the university department I got hired in, I'm now not sure if it actually counts as on campus\nReddit Posts\nemployment as defined by immigration services. For example, the department is not actually located on campus, but\nrather in the university village outside of the main campus. And its service (as the campus human resource department)\nseems more directed to faculty and staff rather than students.\nAnd now I'm panicking a lot because I'm worried I might've accidentally engaged in unauthorized employment. \nSo did I violate my f1 status? does this count as unauthorized employment? Me trying to sort out this situation is giving\nme more anxiety. I'm waiting for the international student center to get back to my email, and I scheduled an\nappointment with the DSO. But I'm just so scared that I totally screwed up and would lose my f1 status because of this. \nPlease help, any insight will be great.\nEdit/update: thank you to all the kind people who replied and offered advice and reassurance. it truly means a lot to me\nand my panicking nerves. I was lucky and got to schedule an appointment with my dso today, and they confirmed that\nbecause the job is paid by the school, it counts as on campus employment.

Here are my documents.\nOfficer: Why US?\nMe: I am going to pursue Ph.D. in Computer Science at UT Dallas.\nOfficer: Do you already have a Masters?\nMe: Yes officer, I have a Masters in Computer Science from xxx in Delhi. \nOfficer: Oh Delhi! (Typing) So why UT Dallas?\nMe: Well, I would like to research in the fields of misinformation and hate speech. There are two great professors, Prof.\nX and Prof. Y who are doing interesting projects in these fields.\nOfficer: Y? Is that her first name? \nMe: Yes officer, I didn't know how to pronounce her last name which is Z, and I didn't want to mispronounce it.\nOfficer: Can you tell me about your Masters Thesis?\nMe: So I worked on XX project which is on various NLP tasks on tweets. It could be sentiment, humor, parts of speech\nReddit Posts\netc. So given a tweet, my algorithm could classify the tweets into a set number of categories that can further be used to\nstudy the tweets better and take proactive actions on inappropriate tweets.\nOfficer: Oh, that's great, quite interesting!

It is fully funded by the university as I have got a graduate teaching assistantship offer from UT Dallas.\nOfficer: (Typing for 45-60 seconds, I thought that's it) So I see you have applied for a Master's course previously, why\ndid you change your course? (I applied MS CS in 2022 and got refused)\nMe: Well, I wanted to research further in the field of Computer Science.

(With the\npassports they were holding)\nTips and steps for visa application and getting your passport back:\n\\- There is no online payment for MRV fee. You need someone physically go to a Vietnam post office to make the\npayment on your visa application number (They just need one page prinout of application number and your passport Bio\npage printout). \n\\- You just need your passport, DS160, and i20 to attend the interview. The rest are just supporting documents that you\nintend to carry. \n\\- Vietnam does not discriminate appointment slots for residents and non-residents. (Singapore and Thailand US\nConsulates do) So you get earlier dates\n\\- I attended my interview in Ho Chi Minh and everything was smooth. I believe Hanoi should only be better since it is a\nbigger one. \n\\- You can opt for premium delivery of passport to your hotel address which should be quick (I hope as claimed on their\nwebsite). I opted for pick up and it took two more days after the US consulate dispatched my passport. Also if you are\nopting for pick-up, you will get an email with the airway bill number. Once you get that email, just give a shot at the\npassport pick-up center (of that post office) since their website does not update the current status of the parcel correctly.\nI luckily got mine when I went there at 4 pm that evening, so I could leave the same night. \nReddit Posts\n\\- Rest you can check out places in Ho Chi Minh when you are around there, you have to just wait it out till you get your\npassport. You can't leave the country without your passport :P \n\\- Grab is a good app for taxi and food delivery. Currency exchange rates are good enough in airport so you can change\neverything needed there. \n&#x200B;\n&#x200B;\n": [

        "There are two options when status requirements are violated by the student and the SEVIS record is\nterminated to reflect that F-1 status violation.\n1. Apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a reinstatement of status. That is by submitting an\nI-539 application to USCIS along with a new reinstatement I-20, a statement from the student describing how the status\nviolation was beyond the student's control, a fee (currently totaling $455), and copies of various immigration documents.\nAnd then waiting many, many months for a response. During which the student is essentially stuck in the U.S. waiting for\na decision without having any F-1 status benefits other than being able to study. No on-campus work. No off-campus\nwork. No internships. No ability to transfer the SEVIS record to a new U.S. school. In the statement the student needs to\nconvince the U.S. government why the status violation was not within the student's control.

If they don't believe the\nstudent's situation is one where the student could honestly declare that there was nothing the student could have done\nto meet the F-1 status requirements, they might not support the reinstatement.\n2. Get a new SEVIS record and new initial attendance I-20. Pay again the SEVIS fee to the U.S. government. Have\nReddit Posts\ndeparted the United States. Use the new SEVIS record and new I-20 to request to enter the U.S. again for new F-1\nstatus. Generally, as long as the F-1 visa hasn't expired, this does not require applying for a new F-1 visa. This process\nresets the student's F-1 status clock in the U.S., so the student won't be eligible for any CPT or OPT until after having\nreturned to the U.S. on the new SEVIS record and having completed one full academic year of study under that new\nSEVIS record.\n- ",

If you don?t have an\nemployer, but need to file taxes where do you get it from? Or is there no need for it?

You subtract the amount of the tax\ndeduction from your income, making your taxable income lower. The lower your taxable income, the lower your tax\nReddit Posts\nbracket and so the lower your tax bill, meaning you will get some money back in tax returns, if these deductibles come\nup through out the year after you had already filled your W2 form and given it to your employer to make a general tax\nwithholding on your behalf to the IR.  \n**What are tax deductions (write offs) that can help you get tax refunds when you file your taxes in the filing Jan to Apr\nperiod?**  \nStandard deductions ensure that all taxpayers have at least some income that is not subject to federal income tax.\nStandard deductions generally increase each year due to inflation. You have the option of claiming the standard\ndeduction or itemizing your deductions. However, you can never claim both in the same year. You will find that many\nstates that impose an income tax will also allow you to claim a similar type of deduction on your state income tax return. \nBecause you can only use either standard deduction or itemized deduction on your taxes, to lower your taxable income,\nthe IRS recommends that you take the time to run the numbers to see which option gives you a bigger deduction\notherwise you might actually be losing yourself some money by deducting less, having a higher taxable income, and\npaying \nmore \nin \ntaxes \nas \na \nresult. \n(See:\nhttps://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-deductions-and-credits/what-are-standard-tax-deductions/L7oiVM1DH)  \n**Things that can go towards an Itemised Deduction (If you choose to do this, instead of the calculated flat standard\ndeduction that the IRS provides for):**  \n\u00b7 Interest paid on your mortgage  \n\u00b7 State income taxes can be deducted.

F1 visa rejected. In such a dire situation, we are\nvoicing our hope for support from communities that we trust and value.\nThis joint letter is a united effort from 28997 Chinese International Students from over 100 US Universities, who are\ndesperately seeking help and support from federal representatives? offices and the community of education and human\nrights organizations. \nCould anyone in this community tell us any suggestions and advice to fight against this unreasonable proclamation since\nBiden has won the whole election? \nPlease unite efforts in helping us end this cruel and racist **Trump proclamation 10043**.\n": [
        "I don't see this as being changed anytime as the proclamation was sort of a nothing proclaimation.\nWhen it came out we were worried, but after the details were announced, no one was really worried anymore. Like many\nTrump policies, it was a lot of flash and show and big words, but in actuality it didn't do muchm\nReddit Posts\nThere are 300-400,000 Chinese students in the US. Of those, this policy would impact between 2-5,000 of them based\non the best estimated numbers. So around one percent of the total Chinese student population is expected to be\nimpacted. That said, more than likely these students were already being denied under other State Department policies\non visa issuance. \nThis Proclamation was mostly political posturing for Trump in the U.S. during an election year. Even before this\nproclamation there was already an internal policy on restricting Chinese students (and other non-allied countries like\nRussia, Iran, Turkey, etc.) with military and intelligence connections. \nPolicies like this have been in place for several decades (Cold War) and Trump did not really add anything other than\nmake a previous internal policy more public to show he was \"strong on China\".\nThe actual impact to Chinese students as a whole should be more/less unnoticeable. Obviously for those who are\ndenied it is pretty impactful, but we shouldn't really see a difference in approval numbers. \n[If \nyou \nare \ncurious \nyou \ncan \nsee \nour \nprofessional \ngroups \nevaluation \nof \nthe\nproclamation.](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-resea\nrchers-connected-prc) \nAs this is a National Security item and has been of concern to the US intelligence community there is no Political Win for\nBiden to reverse this policy or really address it as the actual impact is tiny or even insignificant if many of the impacted\nstudents were already being denied visas. \nI can also tell you, China has a similar policy of restricting visas to current/former foreign military or intelligence\nemployees.  Most countries have similar policies for non-allied or non-friendly countries. \nReddit Posts\nTrump just made a show of making it more public to gain more foreign policy credibility during an election year. \nIf you are concerned due to the lack of visa issuance at Embassy/Consulates in China, this policy has nothing to do with\nthat. The embassy closures are due to COVID-19, limited staff after the evacuation flights, and on going staffing\nlimitations. We expect that May/June as embassy staff return to China that visa processing will begin again. This is\nmostly around vaccine availability and retraining/training staff returning to the embassies. There was a lot of turn over\nand it takes time to get embassy and consular staff trained as well as to get the embassy fully up and running again after\na closure. \nSo, with that context, I hope it helps alleviate some of your concerns on this topic and also why it has not come up as a\nhigher policy agenda. \nBy all means continue to advocate because having the discussion is NEVER a bad thing, but also don't expect any\nimmediate responses to the proclamation. There is no real political win there outside of removing a talking point from\npublishing houses wanting to gain views.\nEdit:Typos\n- ",
        "As noted, this would impact a very small number of Chinese students. It does not apply to\nundergraduate students at all. Undergraduate students are those studying for an Associate or Bachelor's degree, and\nthat's the majority of Chinese students studying in the United States. It impacts only some graduate level study for only a\nsmall percentage of those applying for an F-1 visa for graduate level study. \nEveryone should have the right to petition governments, and you should absolutely use freedom of speech to speak out\nagainst government policies with which you disagree. If you disagree, it is your right to speak out for and petition for\nReddit Posts\nchange. I fully support that right for everyone. \nOP: \"...could cause almost all the new incoming Chinese International Students? F1 visa rejected.\"\nFactually, this Trump act would not any any way result in \"almost all\" Chinese students being denied F-1 visas as the\nOP claimed in this post. 1% is not 99%. It may not be helpful to try to scare students into thinking their visa will be\ndenied for something that wouldn't even be a consideration for the vast majority of F-1 visa applications. \nSo speak out. Petition. Gather and protest. But don't scare Chinese students who would not be denied a visa based on\nthis to think they might be denied.\n"

    " Please, someone tell me I did not lose all my chances to apply for OPT. \nBody of the post: The story is a bit lengthy, but I've tried my best to write it in the most convenient way for the reader.\nAny help and advice are extremely appreciated and helpful, as I'm extremely frustrated and worried. Thank you so much\nto everyone.\nI'm a Business Management major in a good-standing university in Florida. To give you guys a bit of context:\n* Graduation date: May 4, 2024.\n* Applied for OPT: March 13, 2024.\nDuring my last term of school, I had two classes that were difficult for me, and my passing grade depended on how well I\nperformed on finals week:\n* Class X: Final exam date March 29, required grade on the final to pass: 90 (Credit Class)\n* Class Z: Final exam date May 2, required grade on the final to pass: 80 (Major Class)\nReddit Posts\nBased on a prior conversation with the professor from Class X, I was aware that I needed a 90 to get a C-, (which he\ntold me was the passing grade, and which I knew was the passing grade in my school, and which, according to the\nsyllabus, is the passing grade).\nOn the same date as the final exam, I came back upset as I knew I was nowhere near passing the class. I went ahead\nand booked an appointment with both the international and academic advisor as I was a week away from graduation,\nand I knew I needed to act regarding the OPT and summer registration.\nI was able to find the international advisor available that same afternoon. He told me that I would need to send a\nwithdrawal letter to the USCIS ASAP, so I did the letter and sent it via overnight delivery with USPS. He told me it was\ngood that I moved quickly and that he would work on extending my I-20 to repeat that class in the summer.\nThe academic advisor was not available that afternoon, so I booked with her for the following day. I told her I had failed\na class a week before graduation and that I might fail another one if I do not get the required final grade. She assured\nme everything was okay as the office would allow me to walk in the commencement ceremony (my family was arriving in\ntown), but they would just not send my diploma until I completed all credits, which I would need to do in the summer.\nShe also informed me that if I failed Class X, I would need to repeat another class in the summer to cover those credits,\nand if I failed Class Z, I would need to repeat that exact same class in the summer. She promised to reach out to me the\nnext day to send me the list of available summer classes.\nTwo days after that meeting, she sent me an email stating that I would graduate as long as I got a D- in Class X and a\nC- in Class Z. I was shocked as I had never heard of a passing grade of D- in my school, but those were her words, and\nto my surprise, my grade in Class X ended up being a D; therefore, I did pass Class X.\nAt this point, I decided to study even harder for Class Z, as the required grade was lower, and I was much more\nReddit Posts\nconfident than I was for Class X. My family was already in town, and the commencement ceremony was in two days, so\nI had no time to meet with the international advisor until the next week. Additionally, I had yet to receive my final exam\ngrade from Class Z, so I did not want to touch on the OPT, as there was a risk of failing the class.\nAfter the commencement ceremony, I went back to my country to spend time with my family, where I received the news\nthat I had passed Class Z as well. Therefore, I now needed to book an appointment with the international advisor. He\ntold me that he was surprised I left the country and that I should send a letter to USCIS requesting the withdrawal to be\nwithdrawn, since I had now passed both classes, and there was no reason to withdraw my OPT. He also advised me\nthat the most convenient thing to do would be to get on an airplane ASAP and come back because if my OPT were to be\ndenied for some reason, I would have a problem. I told him there was no way I could do that until June 11 (one day ago)\nas I needed to stay for personal and family problems. I wrote the letter titled \"Urgent Withdrawal of Withdrawal Request\nfor OPT Application to Maintain OPT Eligibility\" and sent it to my cousin who lives in Arkansas. He sent it through\novernight delivery on May 14, two weeks after I sent the initial Withdrawal Request.\nIn short, my OPT was denied on June 4, 2024, and I had my airplane ticket to arrive in Miami on June 10. I had many\nappointments with my advisor once the OPT was denied, and I understood that there were not many choices to make.\nAccording to him, me being out of state and having my OPT denied meant I could not reapply from my country, nor\ncould I reapply if I were to come back as I would enter the country as a visitor on my B-2 and not as an F-1 student.\nAfter much back and forth with the advisor and my family, I decided to take the flight on June 10, as I had no one\nwatching my mail to know why it was denied, and I also had my car parked and my apartment to take care of. My\nadvisor also told me that if I were not to take the flight, he could not guarantee a reversal on my application, so I was in a\ntough spot.\nOnce I arrived, I checked the letter in my mail and realized they based their decision on my first Withdrawal Request, so\nit was not a denial but a withdrawal. I have now met with the advisor in person, and it seems that I don?t have many\nReddit Posts\noptions. He told me that he will talk to his boss to see if she has any ideas on what could be done, but apparently\napplying again is not an option. He mentioned something called \"Unbuzzment USCIS,\" which is a platform for them to\nask questions and get solutions to requests that are stuck. However, he told me his office has never used it, and again,\nnothing is guaranteed.\nAs of right now I?m in the states and the officer at the airport told me I?m entering on my B2 for max 6 months. When I\nfirst had my goal of studying in the states was because I envisioned myself working here, this is hard for me as my\nfamily invested a lot of money in my education and the fact that now it seems I won?t get it back its sad and frustrating.\nBefore anyone mentions it, I want to say that this is not the advisor?s fault nor university, I was told that if I receive the\napplication denied and I was out of country could be a problem, however, I did not know it was going to be the end. I\nshould have known better before leaving the country, and I should have known better the responsibilities of being a\nstudent, therefore knowing the passing grade and not being at risk of failing a class. All of this is my fault and I?m aware\nI have made some mistakes, if any one you guys could give me any insights, whatever, everything is appreciated, thank\nyou so much for your time.\nIn conclusion,\n* OPT was denied out of country.\n   * USCIS received a mistaken withdrawal letter I sent when I first believed I failed a class and acted immediately. A\nweek later, I was told I did pass the class and sent a letter to withdraw the withdrawal letter, however they based their\ndecision on the first letter.\n   * I have attached pictures of all the letters.\n   * Picture 1.- First Withdrawal Letter [https://imgur.com/6IbShJ6](https://imgur.com/6IbShJ6)\n \n \n \n* \nPicture \n2.- \nWithdrawal \nletter \nto \nwithdraw \nthe \nOPT \nWithdrawal \nRequest.\n[https://imgur.com/u2B6tJ8](https://imgur.com/u2B6tJ8)\nReddit Posts\n   * Picture 3.- USCIS Answer, dated on letter June 6.

Is there any way to apply for OPT attaching the letters and making sure an officer\nunderstand this was a misunderstanding?\n   * Will an immigration lawyer even help with this case?\n* Is there any way I could change my immigration status from B2 to F1?\n* Could the fact that technically my OPT was withdrawn instead of denied play a role here and give me a second\nchance?\n": [

        "This is my suggestion (I am not a lawyer) - speak to your DSO to see if there is another program you\ncan apply to on the level you just completed.  \nFor example, you completed a BS in Computer Science? is there a program in BS in Computer Engineering you can\ntake? If so, are the core classes you took in CS eligible to apply towards CE? Perhaps if this is an option then you only\nneed to complete an additional semester to graduate in CE. Since you did not utilize your OPT at the Bachelor?s level,\nyou are still eligible to apply at the completion of the 2nd Bachelors.\nIf this is a possibility, you can take this summer to depart and reenter the US with a new I-20 for Fall.\nAnother possibility, does your school have a 4+1 program? Your current SEVIS record is still within the 60 day grace\nperiod so they can do a change of level for the Masters program. Again, you would need to do a travel and re-entry to\nreactivate your f-1 status this summer.\nLastly, read through the USCIS notice to see if there is a way to appeal the decision.  If so, you may want to consider\nsubmitting all of your documentation (do you have emails) and ask your DSO to write you a support letter. \nAll of these options have costs attached to them but it may be worth it to still try to pursue, especially if you are in a stem\nfield. That?s 12 months of opt and then the stem you would be forfeiting if you just return home.\n"

I am hoping that clarifying information that I submit can help overcome this issue, but I'm not sure anymore.\nAlso, apologies to the moderators for the throwaway account, but my main account makes me a little too easily\ndeanonymized.\n**Context:**\nI have received a STEM OPT denial through premium processing because:\n\"A review of your application and supporting documents submitted, as well as the...

I spoke to an immigration attorney who recommended I reapply for my STEM\nextension before my OPT ends instead of filing a motion to reopen/reconsider. I have requested additional\ndocumentation/justifications from the director of my program justifying how my degree matches the CIP code, and why it\ntherefore qualifies for STEM extension. I am hoping this can avoid denial on the same grounds for the new application. \n**Questions:**\nI have some questions, primarily about a planned change in jobs soon after my STEM extension starts. I am due to start\na **new job on Jan 29th**. I had hoped to receive my EAD (through Premium Processing) so that the job change\nprocess could have been easier (just informing my DSO and submitting the final I-983). \nGiven that my new application for STEM extension will still be pending when I start my new job, I wanted to make sure I\navoid any further complications with USCIS.\n1. Reading online, there are conflicting recommendations from different universities on changing jobs while STEM\nextension is pending. Some say it's risky and do not recommend it because USCIS can deny the application if the\nemployer on SEVIS does not match the employer details in the submitted I-765 form. Some say it's straightforward, and\nI would just need to update my DSO within 10 days, and they will send an updated I-20 to USCIS directly.   \n**Is there anything I can do to minimize the risk of denial due to a job change while my STEM extension is pending?**\nReddit Posts\n2. **Is there any way I can request my DSO to provide me a STEM OPT I-20 with my new employer details for future,\nSTEM OPT period dates included?** My new organization is willing to fill out the I-983 form before my start date to\nfacilitate this process. I am currently employed and will be resigning from that role prior to taking on my new employment\n(Jan 26th).  \nMy main concern is that I start this job (Jan 29th) after my current OPT period expires (Jan 14th), and I will be submitting\nmy STEM extension form around Jan 9th. So I am worried about issues with USCIS reviewing my STEM extension\napplication and seeing that my listed employer had not employed me during my OPT period or had not employed me as\nof Jan 15th (start of STEM OPT period).\n3. Given that my first application was denied, do I need to be concerned about any **additional risks with resubmitting an\nI-765 application**?

I also see no chatter about this in my DSO Circles\nor my F-1 immigration law circles. \nHere is my understanding of the situation as I have seen this roll out over the last few months of posts here:\nThis isn't a new interpretation. This is a crackdown. \nReddit Posts\nThis is essentially a crackdown on DSOs who haven't documented majors correctly via CIP codes registered at their\nschool.\nA University has to report each and every degree it offers including the concentrations to the Department of Education,\nalong with the relevant CIP code.\nThe verification that a degree matches the STEM CIP Codes is overseen by the schools Educational Accredit\norganization.\nSome schools are not ensuring their STEM OPT degrees are in fact listed and registered as STEM OPT CIP Codes with\nthe Department of Education.\nThere have been a few posts about this here in the last few weeks. Each time so far, it was because the degree was not\nactually registered as a CIP Code with the Department of Education.\nMy school has had a few denials in the past 2-3 because the degree name did not match the CIP Code. It took a quick\nletter from the Department explaining that CIP Code naming conventions are different than degree naming conventions,\nvalidating the STEM CIP, paperoekring showing it was registered as STEM CIP, and a letter from our accreditation\nagency, and the application was approved\n>For example, an MBA is not a ?major?\nCorrect. It is a degree. An MBA is a Master's Degree with a focus on Business. \nReddit Posts\n>even if the track/concentration for your MBA is Management Sciences, it will be denied under this new interpretation.\nIt should not be. The concentration would be the major in this case.\nEx: Master in Business Administration - Management Sciences.\nNow if the school only registered a single CIP code to the MBA (52.0201 Business Administration) , and didn't have\nseperate breakdowns of the degree for Managment Sciences (52.1301) then this could be a problem. If, to use the\nundergraduate terms; the school treats the concentrations as minors not as majors... That a problem.\nSimple example:\nAnthropology (45.0201) is not a STEM degree... But Archeology(45.0301) is a STEM eligible degree. \nIf you get a PhD in Anthropology at a school, it could be in Cultural Anthropology (45.0204 non-stem eligible) or\nLinguistic Anthropology (30.4701 or 16.0102 or 45.0201 non-stem eligible \n) or Archeology (45.0301 STEM eligible) or even Medical/BioAnthropology (45.0203 non-stem eligible). \nHowever, the Department may only awards a single PhD in Anthropology (45.0201 non-stem eligible) to every focus. \nIn which case, the Archeology student... Despite having on the surface a STEM eligible degree... Got screwed.\nThis could be the case for this MBA issue. \nReddit Posts\nAt my University are working on a business degree to get it certified as a STEM CIP degree because it isn't currently.\nOnce it is, we can issue STEM OPT for that program, which is great!\nSo, I see no other chatter about this in other non-public groups. I have seen similar questions come up since October.\nSo far they have been related to CIP Code issues.\n>Those who have a graduate degree that is not explicitly a ?science? or ?STEM? in title, are now at risk of being denied\nIF and only IF their application was pending at/after August. \nNot a legal or even possible way to determine a STEM degree. See my example with Anthropology above.\n>For example, an MBA is not a ?major? but even if the track/concentration for your MBA is Management Sciences, it will\nbe denied under this new interpretation.\nSee my Anthropology example again. Almost certainly a documentation issue on the school's side.\n>They only want science ?majors?, despite most grad degrees not having a major as it is an undergraduate concept.\nBottom line: Be careful if you only have a STEM concentration. \nThis concept exists at the Graduate level. See my Anthropology example. You can get:\nPhD Anthropology - Cultural.  \nPhD Anthropology - Linguistics    \nPhD Anthropology - Medical/Biological    \nPhD Anthropology - Archeology\nReddit Posts\nOr just PhD Anthropology.\nAll the above are possible. But it depends on how your school's does their paperwork. A smart MBA program converts\nthe entire MBA to one CIP code  Managment Sciences (52.1301).\nHowever there are disadvantages to breaking up a single degree into multiple CIP Codes and many schools don't do it.\nHope this helps.\n"

    " My F-1 is terminated. HELP!!!!\nBody of the post: I was on an F-1 visa but recently got terminated. According to the DSO it was because I missed more\nthan 14 consecutive calendar days.

I wish to\ncontinue to study in the US and do not want to have the terminated record with my SEVIS. so I want to do the\nreinstatement.\nI was sick due to COVID and I encountered health issues with my lungs and chest congestions. Let's go back to when I\nwent to see a doctor and have it on my med record. I received some prescriptions and advice at that time. it was a few\nmonths before this happened but it also led to missing classes later in November. ( I had a doctor's note and missed\nclass that day I went to see a doctor for this one). I encountered the same symptoms again but this time I was also a bit\nsymptomatic COVID but no test for taken. (started around Oct 18) I didn't seek doctors this time, I rested home and did\nhome remedies as the doctor has advised me before. I later tested positive for COVID-19 on November 23, and\nexperienced symptoms which prevented me from attending class, such as shortness of breath and diarrhea. I managed\nmy symptoms by taking nonprescription medications as well as vitamin supplements, based on prior experience of the\nfirst I tested positive. I didn't recover fully after two weeks (tested negative on November 2).\nReddit Posts\nI later received an email from the DSO that my F-1 was terminated because I missed more than 14 consecutive\ncalendar days (From Oct 18 - November 1 to be specific) (I only had class twice a week, Mon/Wed)\nI was unaware of the requirement for a doctor's note to avoid termination (which is what the DSO asked for).\nConsequently, my F-1 record was terminated.\nI've been emailing to the DSO back and forth for the reinstatement process. They require a personal statement of why\nthis was beyond my control and etc.\nQuestion is; what do I do now? If I explain what my situation was in the letter, would they still ask for doctor's notes? As\nwe know, I don't have any because I didn't see a doctor in those two weeks, then what will I do? I'm extremely stressed.\nPlease help if you have any advice or ideas. (FYI, I applied the F-1 visa here after B-2.

You have failed to\nsubmit Form I-765 within 60 days of the date the DSO entered the recommendation for OPT in your SEVIS record, you\nare ineligible for employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(C).\nBased on the above, you have not met the eligibility requirements as outlined in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(11).

You are beyond the application period for STEM OPT.\n>Could you please assist me in understanding the reasons for the denial and finding a solution?\nYep... it looks like the DSO didn't enter STEM OPT into your I-20 record. \nYou can pursue legal action against your school, but STEM OPT. is done. \nYou didn't notice the lack of STEM OPT indication on page 2 of your application and the school didn't enter the STEM\nOPT request into SEVIS.\nThere won't be a CORRECTION from the government as there was no error on the part of the government. They will\npoint out it is your application and your mistake of not checking for STEM OPT being requested. \nReddit Posts\n>Could you please assist me in understanding the reasons for the denial and finding a solution?\n1- DSO made a big mistake. Failed to enter your STEM OPT request.\n2- You didn't check/notice.\n3- Application was denied for lack of the DSO request.\n4- You are outside the application window to submit again.\nThere is no solution for you in the way you are hoping/expecting. \nYou lost STEM OPT. You should consult with an attorney about seeking damages from your school in regards to lost\nwages and lost immigration opportunities due to this mistake/error by your DSO. \nHowever unless you have another way to stay in the US (marriage, sponsorship, TN, new program of study, etc) you will\nbe leaving and leaving soon.\nYou cannot work for you employer starting immediately. Attempting to rectify this with the US government will almost\ncertainly be denied because there was no error on the part of the government in adjudication of your application.\nAdditionally that process takes 6-18 months during which you cannot legally work for your employer and may/may not\nbe able to legally stay in the US. Additionally it will not change the validity of your STEM OPT period so you wouldn't get\nback the time used while submitting a motion for reconsideration.\nReddit Posts\nSo, I would contact an attorney that knows immigration law and hopefully also knows administrative law or is a firm that\ndoes both. Because they will need to help you decide how much you can ask the school for in compensation and if the\nschool doesn't want to negotiate on a settlement then a lawsuit against the DSO/School would be the next step.\nVERY sorry this happened to you.\nFYI, if you wanted another degree/higher level degree your settlement offer with the school could be a fully funded\ndegree from them if they offer something you want. This is generally easier to get as it is cheaper for the school and they\ncan do this without admitting fault. However talk to an attorney and get their advice.\n- ",

    " Filing STEM OPT Extension while being hired through a staffing agency\nBody of the post: Hi! I am currently a contract-to-hire employee through a staffing agency. I am on Post-Completion OPT\nand applying for a STEM OPT extension. My extension was denied by my university's DSO because \"the name of the\nemployer that you are listing for your STEM OPT extension needs to be the same as the employer who is completing\nthe I-983 training plan, whose E-verify number you are submitting on your I-765, who will supervise your day to day\nactivities and listed as such in your request\". \nWhile revising these details on I983 and I765, it's challenging because I am hired through a staffing agency and placed\non the client site. The staffing agency is only willing to fill out Section 3 of I983 and nothing more since they aren't the\nones who supervise me daily. My company is hesitant to provide their E-verify and EIN on I765 because I'm not on their\npayroll. My supervisor already finish Sections 5 and 6 of the training plan.I'm wondering which company I should put as\nmy employer. Both the company I work at and the staffing agency are E-verified. The DSO at my university refuses to\nprovide guidance on that due to legal compliances. My current EAD expires at the end of July. \nMy questions are:\n1. How is E-verify number, EIN, and NAICS code used in the process? Are they just used to make sure the company is\nenrolled in the E-verify program?

    " Self Employment during OPT\nBody of the post: I completed my PhD this summer and applied for post-completion OPT in my grace period. My 90 days\nunemployment clock has just started (EAD approved recently). I am considering going the self-employment route but my\nguess is that if I am not getting a job, I probably won't be getting business either.\nEverything I read on self-employment on OPT says that\n(i) I need the proper business licenses and\n(ii) I must be able to prove that I am actively engaged in the business.\n(It also needs to be full-time in this case and of course it must be related to my degree as usual.)\nWithout clients, I can invest in improving my portfolio but there is not much I can do otherwise. Can anyone comment on\nhow I can show I am \"actively engaged in the business\"? I am sure it wouldn't cause any problems in the short term but I\nheard lots of horror stories about people having all sorts of issues at the citizenship stage down the road about anything\nthat might look sketchy. I just want to do everything by the book.\nI would appreciate any suggestions!\n": [

        "I?m doing the same thing right now. Of course, I?m not qualified to answer your question, but I will fill\nin my experience.

It might be unnecessary to make an LLC for just a one-year\ncommitment, but you never know what the future might hold for you if you have to establish legitimacy that you have\nbeen legally present in the United States.\nEdit: it would also be great to find a client or two that can hire you for a weekly contractual job for up to/more than 20\nhours a week. At least on their end and your end, both parties can provide evidence that you?re working for the time of\nyour OPT.\n- ",

        "Just a technical note. OPT and F-1 reporting are not with USCIS. USCIS is not the agency which\nenforces OPT/F-1 status rules. Your SEVIS record where F-1 updates are made and reported by your DSO (and by you\nif on OPT and using the SEVP Portal) is not with USCIS.\nYour SEVIS record and OPT reporting is all done to and through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).\nSEVP is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), not part of USCIS. SEVP controls SEVIS, not USCIS.\nTherefore, your reporting requirements, and missed reporting requirements, are with and through ICE and not USCIS. \nThe only interaction with USCIS related to OPT is the OPT application as only USCIS can issue an EAD. However, that\nOPT authorization, the reporting, and rules of OPT and F-1 status being enforced is done by ICE, not USCIS. \nThat's also why the OPT reporting portal is called the SEVP Portal (and not the \"USCIS\" Portal). \nThe only way USCIS would be looking at this information is if you submit a new application (or your employer does) for a\nnew immigration benefit or status (such as H-1B). If in that process USCIS makes the determination that you've ever\nbeen in violation of status, they can deny you that new benefit or status for the application with them. \nYour 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month OPT reporting requirements with SEVP/ICE is something you either\ndo or you don't. It's not something you can fix or ask someone else to fix for you if you miss that responsibility. It's not\nyour DSO's responsibility to remind you of your responsibility. Your DSO can't fix it for you if you don't do it on time.\nSEVP puts a link in your SEVIS record within the reporting window that a DSO clicks to confirm your reporting when you\nreport to the DSO. Once the reporting window closes, SEVP/ICE removes the link. And that's it. Reporting opportunity\nhas closed. \nReddit Posts\nWhat happens then? That's up to ICE (and USCIS if you ever submit any new type of application to them). So far,\nhonestly, I've never seen anything happen. Does that mean ICE/USCIS will never care about it? Nope.

Unfortunately, this means you NEED to have an approved OPT\napplication along with a valid EAD card in your hand when entering the United States (very high chances of them asking\nabout the same during CBP inspection). Without these approvals, you're basically showing intent to end your program\nand hence your stay in the US as a student.\nSecondly, post approval of the OPT application, it takes approximately 2 weeks for the card to reach your mailing\naddress. Again, assuming you have someone to pick up this card, you may ask them to send you an international\npriority mail (typically reaches in 1-2 day) and then travel back to the states.\nYou may seek further opinion from an immigration lawyer regarding this to be 100% certain.\n- ",

Most student will file\nin February/March after receiving all their tax documents.\n>I did not work in 2023, do I need to file taxes?\n[You should have filed the 8843 even if you had no income.](http://blog.sprintax.com/tax-form-8843-filing-instructions) \n\"There are 3 things that every US international student and J-1 visa holder needs to know about American tax:\n*Every US international student and J-1 visa holder has a tax filing requirement.   \n*It doesn?t matter if you have earned income. You must still file your documents before the deadline.    \n*The IRS takes this stuff seriously! In other words, if you don?t comply with your tax obligations, you may encounter\ncomplications when applying for US visas in the future. \".  \n>Do I have to pay/file/submit taxes?\nYes, all F-1 visa holders regardless of employment or not need to file their taxes.  \nIf \nyou \nworked \nin \n2023 \nyou \nreceived \ntax \ndocuments \nfrom \nyour \nemployer \n(likely \na\n[W2](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2) or a 1099 of some sort). You will need that form(s). You also need\nto file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf). If this is you continue on to the next question.\nIf you did not work then you need to file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf) That is all that you must\ndo if you otherwise did not work or receive taxable payments.\nReddit Posts\n>What tax programs/software can I use?\nMany, but not all tax software can file taxes for you. However, most are not set up with Non-residents in mind. As such,\nsee the next question.\n>Can I use Turbo tax, HR Block, Tax Slayer, or another program to file my taxes?\nYes, but you need to find out if you are a \"Resident for Tax Purposes\" or a \"Non-Resident For Tax Purposes\". You can\nfind the questionnaire [here](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/determining-alien-tax-status)\nAlternatively, you can go to [Sprintax.com](https://www.sprintax.com) sign up for their program and use the tax\ndetermination questionnaire at the beginning of their software. You do not need to pay to use this portion of their\nsoftware.\nIf you are deemed a non-resident for tax purposes and you like Sprintax's software you can continue to use it for your\ntaxes and pay them for convenience. If you want another option there is [Glacier tax Prep](https://www.glaciertax.com)\nBoth of these companies specialize in Non-Resident Taxes. You can also just complete the 1040NR\nIf you are deemed a resident for tax purposes you can use any other tax software designed for an American. Such as\nturbo tax, Tax Slayer, etc.\n>Is the tax rate for residents and non-residents on F1 vastly different? When I enter the same details as a resident on\ntax estimator sites like turbo tax and hr block I get much higher refund estimate then what I get from sprintax.\nThe tax rate isn't different. But tax obligations are different. Both Turbo Tax and HR block are generally NOT for\nReddit Posts\nnon-residents. They almost exclusively process resident taxes and all estimates are based off of tax residency. So as a\nnon-resident for tax purposes, you will never get a valid estimate there.  Non-residents pay fewer taxes and are eligible\nfor fewer refunds as a result. So the number you enter will be with fewer taxes and they then Turbo Tax and HR block\nadd the greater discount. Also, there is NO difference between programs or software in what taxes you get. The tax rate\nis the same for everyone. So no program will give you a benefit as the tax laws are the same. However, they can be\nprogrammed to not ask the correct question to obtain your tax filing status.\n>I was deemed a \"Resident for Tax Purposes\" am I now eligible for permanent resident benefits? \nYour **TAX status** is separate from your immigration status.\nYour **TAX status** is informed by your immigration status.\nYour **TAX status** has no impact on your immigration status.\nThat's why it says, \"Resident for tax purposes\". You are not an actual resident of the US and your immigration status\nhas *not* changed. You are just now given more flexibility with your taxes and qualify for some additional tax benefits\nyou didn't otherwise qualify for before. That said, you also have more tax liability now compared to before.\nIt is 100% separate from your immigration status and does not, can not, and has not granted you any sort of permanent\nresidency in any way shape, or form.\n>I got a 1098-T, can I use it?\nYou can only use a 1098-T if you are a Resident for Tax Purposes. Otherwise, it does not apply to you.\n>I received a W2 and/or 1042-s and/or 1099, what do I do with these?\nReddit Posts\nThese documents are used for filing your taxes. If you worked or received taxable income/benefits you will receive any\ncombination of these. If you did not, work or receive taxable benefits you would have none of them.\n>I have Dependents on F2\nYou need to file your taxes based on the above and file an 8843 for each dependent.\n>My spouse on their own F1 needs to file\nHave them follow the procedure above and file their own taxes separately.\n>I arrived in the US in December 2023. My friend arrived in January 2024. I heard that if you were present in the U.S. in\nF/J status for any portion of the previous calendar year (the year for which you are filing), you need to file Form 8843. Do\nI need to file form 8843 for the 2023 tax year since he arrived US in Dec, 2023?\nCorrect. You have an I-94 with any date in 2023, you file. Not employed in 2022? Then just the 8843 form.\n>My friend got a refund and I had to pay\nThat happens, there are many reasons it could happen. Taxes are VERY individual. It is possible your friend also filed\nusing the incorrect status Resident vs. Non-Resident etc. You also could have filed wrong. If you are concerned, then\nuse the software linked above to get an answer. If you are still confused after that contact the software provider for\nsupport.     \nReddit Posts\n>How do I use tax form 1099-A/M/J/L/Misc\nYou can use the tax software above to file your taxes or follow the instructions on the 1040-NR for non-residents or\n1040/1040-EA for Residents\n>When do I get my refund?\nIf you are eligible for a refund you must submit your application as a non-resident via the mail to the IRS on/before April\n15 and will receive the refund in July-October. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank\naccount. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this Fall.\nResidents and Non-Residents who can file electronically can receive the refund in a few business days depending on\nhow you filed your taxes. Via the mail, it takes several weeks. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your\nvalid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this summer.\nI don't know where I will be in the Fall/Summer or I am leaving the U.S. this Spring/Summer!  Ask a friend you trust to\nuse their mailing address.\n>Can I file my non-resident taxes online?\nYes, but e-filing can be limited by the tax filing services. \n>I do not have a Social Security Number (SSN) Can I file taxes? \nYes, but if you are not filing only the 8843 then you need an ITIN or an SSN. \nReddit Posts\nYou can get an ITIN using Spritnax (for an additional fee) or via a private company using the [Acceptance Agent\nProgram](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program) (for a fee) or you can\nschedule \nan \nappointment \nwith \nthe \nIRS \nat \none \nof \nthe \n[IRS \nTaxpayer \nAssistance\nCenters](https://www.irs.gov/help/tac-locations-where-in-person-document-verification-is-provided) to both submit your\ntaxes and the ITIN request form in person at one of their offices for free. You will need to call, schedule an appointment\nand bring all completed documents to the office for the submission of the ITIN request and submitting your other tax\nforms. If you use one of the software above as a non-resident then you can print and bring the documents from that\nsoftware to their office.\n>How does one pay for taxes on the medical ratio refund? But if you don?t pay for insurance ex it is covered by a\nfellowship/scholarship then how do you account for it on your tax return?\nI assume you mean the 1095 forms.\n**Form 1095-A: ?**   \nHealthcare coverage purchased through Health Insurance Marketplace ? ?ObamaCare?? or the Affordable Care Act\n* *Generally not applicable to international students & scholars? unless you have a special tax treaty*\n* Can be used on a ?resident? tax return, in limited circumstances?\n**Form 1095-B: ?**   \nHealthcare coverage provided through an insurance provider or self-insured employer?\n*You do not need 1095-B for your non-resident return?*\n**Form 1095-C:?**   \nReddit Posts\nHealthcare provided through an employer (generally more than 50 employees)?\n*You do not need 1095-C for your non-resident return*\n***Additional Helpful Resources***\nGet your past tax filing transcripts which include your tax information and which returns the IRS has from you.\nhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript\n": [

        "Hello everyone, I don?t know if I should freak out: I?ve been an F1 student since 2019 and was not\ninformed from my DSO or anyone that I was required to pay taxes.

        "Hello! I know that f1 students are exempt from meeting the substantial presence test for the first five\ncalendar years. Just double checking that if I?m on an f1 for the second time (masters), does this 5 year exemption\nre-apply? For context, I did undergrad in NYC from 2015-2019. I stayed for a year of OPT then left in Sept 2020. For my\n2020 tax return, I filed as a US resident for tax purposes. After my visa expired I returned home and stopped filing bc I\nhad left the US. Then in Aug 2022 I returned to NYC to pursue my masters. So last year, I filed as a nonresident alien\nfor tax year 2022 through sprintax (form 8843). However, I?m filing now through sprintax again and they?re saying I\nneed to file as a US resident and need to file through turbo tax.

    " Staying in US vs UK\nBody of the post: I?m a graduate student in US (Pakistan, F1, IT) and working as a TA at a for profit insitute. My\nuniversity has expressed interest in sponsoring my H1B if I teach there on my OPT. Before coming to US, I worked as a\nhigh school teacher.

I have a year to upskill myself so I get a job.

    " RFE for F1 OPT\nBody of the post: I filed for my F1 OPT in October 2023 and recently got a response from USCIS with RFE that needs to\ninclude additional documentation to establish that I have maintained lawful and valid F-1 nonimmigrant status while\nenrolled as an F-1 Student.\nThis evidence must include but is not limited to:\n1. A statement from the Designated School Official (DSO) and the Registrar attesting to your physical presence in the\nclassroom;\nReddit Posts\n2. A full description of your course of study/academic program, including all graduation requirements such as the\nnumber of credits or classroom hours and your college?s definition of ?full course of study? for your degree level;\n3. Copies of your course syllabi for all classes and coursework in which you earned credit towards your degree. Provide\ndelivery method (in person/lecture, lab, virtual, online, tele-learning, broadcast, satellite, etc.) of the course if not listed\non the syllabus;\n4. Proof of tuition payments made by you for the duration of your enrollment;\n5. Submit a copy of your most recent bank statements to include all deposits and withdrawals.\nI don't understand why I got this request from USCIS. I had submitted all the required documents with signed OPT within\n5 days of receiving it (should be within 30 days of I-20 issuance), along with correct photos. I have no idea what's the\nreason behind it. My DSO has asked me to reach out to like 5 different University departments to request all the\ndocuments and write a cover letter stating that you have collected necessary evidence and list the items attached in\nresponse to the RFE notice.\nI had no idea that this was even possible and such a request could be sent out by USCIS and I wasn't prepared for the\nadditional headache, specially in this job market. I?ll appreciate credible advice on how to go about this issue.\n**UPDATE:**  \nI'm updating this post since I have received too many DMs.\nI got all the above mentioned documents from my school, apart from the bank statement. I was constantly in touch with\nmy DSO and the ISSS Office to gather the documents ASAP. From my experience, the ISSS Office at my school was\nkind of clueless about this process so I had to take the initiative to gather everything I needed quickly. The only\ndocument that was tricky to get was the DSO and Registrar letter attesting to my physical presence. I could only get a\nletter of enrollment from the Registrar, and it worked. It stated that I was a full-time on-campus student.\nReddit Posts\n**Timeline:** Filed for my OPT on Oct 17, 2023. I got the RFE on Nov 16, 2023, and they provided a deadline of Feb 12,\n2024. I would strongly recommend checking the USCIS website as frequently as possible, they post all communication\nthere. I did not receive any email notification about this, and I received their mail well over a week later. I contacted my\nDSO and ISSS Office right away and was able to gather all the documents within 10 days. I also wrote a cover letter\n(Googled the format) that contained a clear response and a list of all the documents that I was submitting.\nI got the approval from USCIS in two days of submitting all the documents and received the EAD card one week from\napproval.\nLastly, I just want to say that if you receive an RFE, don't panic. They just need some more information from you. Most\nof these documents will be provided to you by your school. So try to work with your DSO, and if you're unsure about\nwhat document is being asked for or where to obtain it, don't hesitate to ask them or your Advisor. But yeah, most\nimportantly, be on top of this process and keep checking the USCIS website for any communication until you have the\nEAD card in your hands.\n": [

    " F1 renewal experience on STEM OPT in Hyderabad, India\nBody of the post: Hi Everyone \nI posted here about a month ago asking for advice regarding renewing my F1 visa stamp while on STEM OPT. I looked\nthrough posts on this sub extensively to read about other?s experiences and it was very helpful for me so I thought I\nwould share my more recent experience.\nWhen I realized I needed to renew my visa stamp on **July 2nd,** I immediately filled out DS-160 form\n([https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/](https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/) \n) \nand \nVisa \napplication \nform\n([https://portal.ustraveldocs.com/applicanthome](https://portal.ustraveldocs.com/applicanthome) \n), \nand \nmade \nthe\napplication payment. I received my payment receipt and was able to see available appointment dates at different\nlocations. \nReddit Posts\nI qualified for the drop-box/interview waiver appointment. The U.S visa application website will tell you if you are eligible\nfor interview waiver appointment based on the questions you answer.\nInitially, I got an appointment for July 19th at the Chennai VAC, but I was looking for an earlier appointment date\nbecause I afraid I would lose my job. I decided to hire an agent to help me with my visa appointment. Promptly, he was\nable to get me a drop-box appointment at the Hyderabad VAC for **July 10th**. \n**July 10th** \\- The Hyderabad VAC is easy to find and if you tell any auto driver/Ola cab driver Hitech City metro\nstation, they will take you to the right location. The VAC office is located on the second floor of the metro station. There\nis a printing shop/photo studio near the lift in case you need something last minute. \nOnce you take the lift to the VAC you will see several counters and people waiting in line. You can drop your documents\nat the counter. There are officers on the floor guiding people and you can ask them if you need any help. My\nappointment was at 10:00am and I arrived at 9:00am. At around 9:15am, they started calling individuals with\nappointment at 10:00a.m to come forward and stand in line. I showed my appointment letter and was let into the line. I\nwas in line for 20 minutes before it was my turn.\nBased on what I read, I wanted to be overly cautious and I arrived with the following documents:\n\\- Copy of i20 \n\\- Passport\n\\- 2 VISA compliant pictures\nReddit Posts\n\\- Appointment confirmation letter\n\\- DS-160\n\\- Employment verification letter \n\\- Most recent Paystub\n\\- Copy of EAD card\n\\- SEVIS fee payment receipt\n\\- Visa application fee receipt\nWhen it was my turn, I showed my appointment confirmation letter and submitted the following documents: **copy of**\n**i20, passport and 2 VISA compliant pictures. No other documents were asked.** They will stamp and return your\nappointment letter once they collect the documents. This took approx. 5-10mins. \n**July \n11th \n?** \nOn \nthe \nvisa \napplication-tracking \nwebsite\n([https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?App=NIV](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?\nApp=NIV) ) my status was updated to **received**\n**July 13th ?** Status changed to **Approved**\n**July 18th ?** Status changed to **Issued**\nReddit Posts\n**July 19th** **-** I received an email stating my passport was ready for **pick up** \nI picked up my passport at the same location ? Hyderabad VAC. The email I received had very little detail regarding\ncollecting my passport. It just stated document delivery will be at Hitech City metro station and after doing some\nresearch, I took the following documents:\n\\- Original Adhar card\n\\- Copy of Adhar card \n\\- Stamped visa appointment confirmation letter\nPassport pick-up is from 10:00a.m to 4:00p.m. While I was waiting in line, the officer asked everyone to add your\npassport number, signature and date on the Xerox version of Adhar card. \n**July 20th** \\- collected passport with Visa stamp for 5 years even though my STEM OPT is valid only for couple more\nmonths. \nI hope this helps!\n": [

Anyone had a good experience?\nThanks!\n": [
        "I went home after 4 years, after my STEM OPT EAD was approved. This was in October 2022 and I\nused the interview waiver (used the Dropbox). I was scared since I have been on F1 in the US for more than 10 years at\nthis point (i.e, more burden to prove a non-immigrant intent) and did my Ph.D in one of the TAL areas. I still took the risk\nsince I had to meet my family whatsoever. \nSurprisingly I got the visa approved in 5 days, and stamped for a full 5 years even though I had only about 2.5 years at\nmax for OPT.  I had spoken to multiple friends who went back to get F1 restamped during the visa-waiver period, and\neveryone I knew was called back for interview, and some even got 221g's. I was mentally prepared for an interview call\nand further processing. I had told my family about the risks and that there may be a chance I would stay back for 3-4\nmonths.

Before this, I had a Master's from a\ndifferent school, and then I worked for 3 years on OPT and STEM OPT, before starting my PhD studies. I F1 visa\nexpired in June 2022, and I am planning to go back to India to get it renewed in May 2023. \nMy question is, what are some common reasons for the Visa officer to reject my visa extension? I don't think I have\nbroken any rules to the best of my knowledge (except for when I submitted my 12 month evaluation late to my DSO).\nAlso, how likely is it for F1 visa renewal rejections, compared to first time visa application rejections?\nPlease note - I am asking about F1 visa extensions, not about first time F1 visa application.\nThanks a bunch!\n": [
        "You can be rejected for three reasons. \n1. Lack of ties to home country.    \n2. Lack of financial documents/incomplete financial documents.     \n3. Otherwise banned from F-1 status.     \n4. Blacklisted for security reasons.\n- ",
        "I was a visa officer for nine years.

At renewal, a visa officer will want to know that you are still able to pay for your education.\nAlso, they will want to verify that your true intentions are to study, rather than just use an F1 visa to do CPT or OPT.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

    " F1 status terminated for address update error. Please help!!\nBody of the post: I arrived in the USA on 26th August 2022 and joined my program on 29th August 2022. On 31st\nAugust 2022, I updated my local American address in the ISSO portal of the university. But because of some formatting\nissue and lack of guidelines regarding filing the form, it wasn?t verified, for which I received an email from the ISSO on\nthe same day. As soon as I started getting my bills, I tried updating my address and got success on 2nd October 2022.\n Following this, on 4th October 2022, I got an e-mail from the ISSO stating that my F1 status was terminated on 21st\nSeptember 2022 and I should explore the options available for its restoration. This mail was 14 days after the F1\ntermination. The only mail that I had received was regarding my invalid address as told above.\nFollowing all of this, I booked an appointment with an immigration advisor. The advisor conveniently said, \"We are sorry\nas you (Akriti) were mistakenly overlooked by the ISSO- UTD from any reminder email regarding the deadline of 21st\nSeptember 2022?, owing to which I had to face F1 visa termination. They have provided with me with options to file a\npetition for reinstatement or to travel out of US and return with a new I-20 and SEVIS number.\nI need reddit help to figure out the best way possible. Should i apply for I-539 or travel and return? Travelling out will\nReddit Posts\nhave financial implications but 539 route can take a lot of time before getting a reinstatement, and that too is not sure.\nAlso, as it was an overlook by University, how liable am I in this whole case as I was trying to update the documents ona\nregular basis but they got approved only on 2nd October 2022.\nPlease help!!\n": [
        "Let me explain what happened because there is a lot misunderstanding in this thread.\nSchools have 30 days from the start of the academic term to register students. If we cannot do that, a students record\nwill automatically be terminated.\nOne of the things we must do is enter a students address into SEVIS. Without an address registration isn't possible.\nBased on the given dates, it looks like this in fact was part of the issue. The address given was not acceptable for\nSEVIS. OP then took over a month to correct the issue. By then it was beyond the 30 day reporting deadline.\nSo the issue from the school was poor communication, but otherwise it was due to slow response of OP to get a valid\naddress submitted. Again, better communication could have prevented this, but it is an obligation that OP had to fulfill.\nGoing to the question at hand, it is almost always better to travel and reenter. If not, you cannot leave until the I-539 is\nadjudicated. That can be 12-18 months currently AND if denied then OP could have more significant consequences.\nThe only time I advice I-539 is when a student has an expired visa or is from a country with difficulties in travel (Iran for\nexample).\nReddit Posts\nAnswering your question about how was this overlooked by the University and how are you liable?\nYour immigration status is YOUR immigration status. Technically a DSO designation is supporting the government and\nthe school. Not the student. It is about maintaining immigration regulations. If a student fails to maintain those\nregulations it is the students responsibility not the schools. Functionally schools are much more supportive because l,\nwhy would we not? So often a International student coordinator/advisor/counselor is also a DSO. This gives them\ninstitutional obligations to support students, but it does not create immigration requirements to support students.\nSo, there could be a request from the school for finacial support for the I-539 payment or supporting travel due to their\nlack of follow up, alerts, acknowledgement, warnings, etc. But that would only be based on institutional policy and would\nnot be impacted by immigration regulations.\nAlso, OP I wouldn't call a submission August 31 and then another October 2nd \"update documents ona regular basis\". If\nyou submitted additional times and only had Sucess on the 2nd then it would be different, but your description sounds\nlike two attempts.\nFyi: Your schools International Student office has a, \"how are we doing survey\". You can submit a complaint there. You\ncan also submit your complaint to the director of the office and your university Ombudsman. Request financial support\nfor travel and reentry (ex:school pays the new SEVIS fee) or pays the I-539 fee.\nEvery school eventually makes a mistake. We typically have one at this level every 18 months. With thousands of\nstudents it will eventually happen even with good planning. What seperates schools is their response to these errors.\nWe have a budget to help correct these types of errors. We cannot pay for travel, but will generally cover administrative\nfees.\nReddit Posts\nHope this helps with background, context, and some ideas going forward.\nEdit: Spelling\n- ",

    " Options to remain in the US during academic suspension\nBody of the post: Hi, I'm an international student currently being suspended for one semester due to underperformance\nin the previous two semesters. It's a difficult time for me to leave the US since my parents are abroad as well, and\nreturning to my home country comes at an extremely high cost. I have asked the international program office and\nacademic advisor at my university for options. OPT doesn't seem to be a viable option, since I'm majoring in computer\nengineering, and looking for an internship with my status is pretty much impossible. And enrolling in community college\nis also not a great option, because I just finished my junior year and there aren't many courses left for me to take except\nengineering courses. Are there any viable options for me to stay for this semester? I also possess a valid R B1/B2 visa.\nDo I have any options for remaining here for half a year? If I just stay here for one semester, will I be in any trouble?\nThanks\nJasper\n": [
        "If you're suspended from school, your F-1 status stay will end very quickly upon suspension unless you\nvery quickly get admitted to another U.S. school and quickly transfer your SEVIS record there. Otherwise, your current\nschool will have to terminate your SEVIS record and I-20. You can't maintain F-1 student status stay in the U.S. when\nyou're no longer academically eligible to be a student at the I-20 school. There is then no on-campus work authorization,\nno CPT, and no OPT. There is no F-1 stay in the U.S.\nReddit Posts\nYour only option to stay in the U.S. in F-1 student status is to transfer your SEVIS record to another school before your\nSEVIS record is terminated. And then you would have to be a student there. The suspending school has a government\ndeadline to terminate your SEVIS record within 21 days of the time notification of suspension is sent to you. That ends\nyour F-1 status stay in the U.S. There is no grace period beyond that. \nIf you have a B-2 visa, you could leave the U.S. and apply to enter again as a tourist. But to return to study again you\nwould need to leave the U.S. yet again. Then get a new SEVIS record and I-20. Then return to the U.S. again to restart\nF-1 status.\n- ",
        "Don't know about the visa side of things but if you're not looking for internships because of your grades\nthat's unnecessary.

    " Fraud IT Consultant Company, Any advice?\nBody of the post: I am a recent graduate on OPT. During my search for a job I was contacted by this IT consultant\ncompany. The job offer was that I would work as an unpaid intern, training to learn a new skillset for about 6 weeks, then\nthey would update my resume with all the new skills that I learned and send it out to their clients afterwards. If for some\nreason I left the company I would have to pay for the training which was about $10,000. This seemed like an okay deal\nbecause I didn't intend on quitting and it sounded good for my OPT because they said they would also sponsor my H1B\nvisa. \nAfter the training was done and they wanted to begin marketing me to their clients they produced a completely fake\nresume. This resume had nothing on it from me except my actual name. They gave me 7+ years of false experience and\nlisted multiple companies that I 'worked at' when I never even heard of these places. \nThis felt very unethical and deceitful to me so I did not want to move forward with it. The time I spent as an unpaid intern\nReddit Posts\nfor this company I could have spent looking for an actual job.

        "This is why researching is critical before making such a move especially with something as delicate as\nOPT. I was approached by the same type of companies.

The other red flag was when they started asking me for personal\ninformations before an offer was even made. One of them even went as far as asking me social security related\ninformation.

I scored well in all my assignments and\ntests (basically 90or more out of a 100 in each) but there was a group project that was worth 30% of the total. I hate\nReddit Posts\ngroup projects, especially after coming here since I?ve been shafted twice by it including this time. The group project\ntanked embarrassingly and we got the lowest grades in class. My individual contribution gave me 20 out of the 30\npossible points but the overall score was still too low. So instead of the safe A or even A+ that I was aiming for, I ended\nup with a B. Now my cumulative GPA is still lower than 3.0 and that means I will not be able to graduate this term. \nThe biggest problem is that I applied for Post OPT and although it hasn?t been approved yet it has been over a month.\nMy program end date was updated to May 6th and I just find out that I wont graduate. What do I even do now? My\nadvisor tells me I have to request my school?s graduation department to move my graduation term to either summer or\nfall and enroll in another course but the international student affairs advisor committee (the DSO) told me that I would be\nable to continue with the Post OPT i20 and just enroll in an additional course if I don?t end up graduating (i asked them\nabout all possible options/outcomes two months ago just to be prepared). It seems like the two departments are saying\ntwo different things and I am not sure where to go from here. \nI have been on probation from three consecutive terms with significant improvement in each. Theres hardly anything\nmore I could?ve done in the other terms since I maxed out the grades except in one and of course that had the other\ngroup assignment which dragged me down. I can?t force anyone else to work or finish everything on my own and now\nbecause the grades didn?t matter so much to others not on probation I might have to drop out and move back to my\nhome country. \nPlease help me.\n": [

    " Seeking Advice: Initial OPT Expiring Soon, Should I Apply for STEM Extension Now\nBody of the post: Hey everyone,\nI'm currently in a bit of a dilemma and would appreciate some guidance from those who have been through similar\nsituations or have knowledge about it.\nReddit Posts\nHere's my situation: My initial OPT (Optional Practical Training) is set to expire in mid-June, and my company is\nplanning to put my name in for the H1b lottery. However, I understand that I also need to apply for a STEM extension.\nAs I'm approaching the 90-day mark of my initial OPT, I'm unsure whether I should start the process for the STEM\nextension now or wait until the results of the H1b lottery come out.\nAdditionally, I've heard about something called the STEM Extension CAP gap, but I'm not entirely clear on how it works.\nFrom what I gather, I can apply for the STEM extension in the last month before my initial OPT expires, and as long as I\napply before the last day of my initial OPT, I'll get a 180-day CAP gap. Can someone please explain this concept in\nsimpler terms and clarify if it applies to my situation? Will I be able to work during this period?\nSo, what do you suggest? Should I wait until the end of March and then start the process for the STEM extension, or\nshould I do it as soon as possible?\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.\n": [

Firstly you have to get I-983 plan ready with all the details of the company (you may have\nto reach out to HR or immigration team at your company), then ask your manager to write the training plan as part of the\ni983. Depending upon your manager?s timeline, you may easily take 1-2 weeks by the time you have your i983 ready.\nThen you have to submit i983 to your DSO and apply for new I-20. This may take a week. Then you apply for STEM\nReddit Posts\nOPT. These days it?s taking 3 or more than 3 months to get STEM OPT. You can keep working even without the EAD\ncard on your hand. But as I said you have many things to plan even before you officially apply. Atleast get your i983\nready. I think once you get your i20, you have to apply in 3-4 weeks for STEM OPT, otherwise it gets rejected. So if you\nwant to wait, maybe you can get your i93 done and wait for lottery results. If you don?t get it, go ahead and apply for i20.\n- ",

My passport isn't on the exemption list so I needed to get a\nMexico visa. I did this months prior and it was a relatively quick experience. Whole process took 3-4 hours and I got the\nvisa same day. Once I got my visa, I bought my airline ticket. I flew Southwest airlines, I recommend it. \nWhen I landed in Cancun Mexico, the immigration lady was a bit mean and she asked if all I have was my Mexico visa (I\nassumed that was enough) but she asked for my US visa, when she saw it was expired she told me to wait aside while\nshe checks on something. I don't think this is normal but she spoke to a supervisor and that person told her all I need is\nthe Mexico visa. So I got in, this whole process took maybe 15 minutes. \nReddit Posts\nThe part that matters, coming back to the US. My flight was at 1:45PM so I got to the airport at 9AM but found out the\ncheck in counters at the Cancun airport opens at 10am but they didn't attend to anyone until 10:45. Anyway, I went up to\nthe counter with all my documents (I-94, I-20, print out of the automatic revalidation law, STEM OPT EAD card, passport\nand visa). The guy at the counter was very helpful and communicated with CBP and they said I was clear to travel.\nHowever, printing out a boarding pass took forever (45 minutes).\nWhen I landed in the US at the border, be ready to stand your ground. The first immigration officer laughed at my face\nand said \"F1 don't get Automatic revalidation\", I told him \"you are not correct, I did my research\". Then he passed me on\nto a different agent who worked on it. She instructed I go pick up my bags from baggage claim and come back. Once I\ngot back, she handed me back my passport with the stamp on it. This process took 15-20 minutes. \n**TL;DR:** If your passport isn't one of the exempted ones, get a Mexican visa.

    " I-20 & F-1 Status Violation. PLEASE HELP!!\nBody of the post: I am an international student in the states right now graduating soon in May . I was doing CPT for 12\nmonths (CPT ended in beginning of April) and only full-time (holiday and school breaks). While I was applying for OPT, I\nrequested for my newest I-20 and realized that my CPT I-20 indicates that I've been working full-time during the Spring\nsemester, and clearly I have been working part-time during my entire internship. I contacted my DSO to update my CPT\nI-20 but said SEVIS wouldn't allow them to make changes and there's nothing they can do about it and I'd have to\nremain \"full-time\" status on my current I-20.  \nKeep in mind that this DSO had been giving me problems rather than assisting me. They've stated that everything is\nunder the student's responsibility (I guess this includes incorrect immigration document filing/information). Not being able\nto go in office in-person and sending emails are just making things hard because the International center staff are all\nwoking remotely. The DSO wouldn't reply till end of day or even few days later.\nDoes this mean I have violated my F-1 status for \"working\" full-time CPT during the Spring semester? Is there a way I\ncould call SEVIS to make amendments? Will my OPT get denied due to the circumstances above? Please help a fellow\ninternational student out!! Thank you!!!\nReddit Posts\n": [

In one it seems to indicate you were doing full-time work part of the time,\nand in the other you state you've been working part time the entire internship. So which is it? \nBeing authorized for CPT doesn't actually require you to do the CPT. It is authorization that *allows* you to do practical\ntraining. For F-1 status purpose, it doesn't then obligate or require you to do that practical training. If you are authorized\nfor full-time CPT and then only work part-time, that's not an F-1 status violation. It just means you didn't work full-time. \nThat's for F-1 status purposes. Of course, if you're required to do a full-time internship to earn your degree and you don't\ndo that, that's an academic matter. \nIt would be a violation if you were only authorized for part-time CPT and then worked full-time. That would be a violation\nas you would be doing work for which you were not authorized. Even during school breaks. On-campus work is allowed\nfor more than 20 hours per week during school breaks. There's nothing that allows someone on part-time CPT to work\nfull-time just because school is on break. Working full-time on part-time CPT authorization would be a violation. Working\nfull-time in a CPT position requires full-time CPT authorization for the time spent working full-time. \nThe only way full-time CPT impacts OPT is that one year of full-time CPT authorization makes one no longer eligible for\nOPT.\nReddit Posts\n- ",
        "SEVIS does not always allow edits to the full CPT information once the CPT has started. Your DSO\ncertainly wouldn't want to change your full CPT history to \"part-time\" CPT as you've stated here that for part of that time\nyou did work full-time. That would be a huge immigration problem for you. \nIf you are truly working part-time now, the DSO could end the current CPT authorization in SEVIS as of the current date.\nThe DSO could then start a new CPT authorization going forward for part-time.\n- ",

So by the time I found out about the issue it was too late to do anything. I ended up getting a H1b visa\nafterward so things kinda worked out eventually\n- ",
        "It happens. The most common reasons I think are:\n- missed time window. There?s the 30-60-90 rule, that you have to apply within 30 days of your DSO endorsing your\nI-20, no later than 60 days after your program has ended and no earlier than 90 days before. I?d say the leading cause\nof OPT denials is people not upholding one of those 3. \n- DSO error. DSO are only people too and unfortunately, they sometimes make mistakes. Not often but I?ve heard about\ncases when someone?s DSO issued a new I-20 but forgot to change the date in SEVP portal, resulting in the application\nbeing delivered past the 30 day window.\n- using an outdated version of the form. Always use the form from the USCIS website.\n- Missing signature or some other info: I think that they?ve recently allowed people to resubmit while maintaining original\nfiling date but still, missing signature on either I-765 or I-20 will be grounds for denial\n- wrong fee - this one was quite specific for last year.

        "It's rare and usually for a technical reason like a problem with the application fee. If someone applies\noutside of the eligible application dates that will get a denial. Submitting the application without first getting the OPT\nrecommendation in SEVIS/OPT I-20 from the DSO will result in denial. Occasionally someone who wasn't technically\neligible to apply will get through and get denied. Examples would include someone who already had a previous OPT at\nthe same or higher degree level or someone who didn't meet the full academic year requirement.\nApplying online now should, in theory, end application rejection due to application fee issues as the application is only\nsuccessfully submitted if the online fee payment goes through.\n- ",

        "During my undergrad, I did two co-ops accumulating 350 days (356 according to USCIS) of CPT. I was\nunder the 365 days limit regardless.

Devastated is an understatement to describe how I felt at that moment. I work my\nbutt off during undergrad, extending my graduation by 2 years by doing 2 co-ops so that no employer can ignore me for\nlack of experience, only to be in the situation that I was in. After notifying the HR of the Nebraska DOT (who I had the\njob offer with before graduation) about the denial, they revoked my offer since they had already waited for almost 2\nmonths for me to start. Within 12 hours, I also got a rejection from the other firm I was hopeful about. I walked to my\nschool with a heavy heart asking them for any help they could provide. Another senior epmployee at the Internation\nStudent Office went through my I765 form and could immediately see the reason for denial. Luckily, I had a week left to\nreapply which was time left upto the 60 day mark after graduation. I mailed my application again on that day itself with\nthe correct dates along with former employers' letter saying the same for additional proof because a motion to re-open\nthe case was more expensive and time consuming. Craziest part was that I actually got a call from an USCIS agent\n(which I first thought was a scam lol) on around the 40th day mark after my second time applying, asking me why I have\napplied again when it was rejected the first time? He joking said that you can keep applying...we like your\nmoney...WOW! I explained the whole situation to him and pointed out the proof of employment dates from my co-op\nemployer. When he gave me a verbal approval, I was more than relieved. Rightaway, I got my case approved the very\nnext day on the portal.

Kinda stressed out about this situation and would\nappreciate any input.\nI graduated last May and I have been working with my current employer since 06/11/23 on a post-completion OPT. This\ninitial OPT expires on 06/12/24. My F1 visa stamp expires on 07/04/24.\nI am leaving to my home country on 04/26 (this friday) and returning on 05/28.\nDue to delays with preparing the i983 for my STEM Extension request, I might not be able to submit the I-765 request to\nUSCIS before I leave the country. And AFAIK, you can only submit I-765 while in the US.\nThe sticky situation is that I have an appointment to renew my F1 visa stamp in India on 05/01. How risky is it to renew\nthe visa while on the last month of initial OPT? Any horror/success stories?\nNow I have 2 options:\n- Cancel the visa renewal appointment and fly back on 05/28 (my planned return date). I will then submit the I-765 with\nPremium Processing as soon as I land in the US. My visa stamp will expire on 07/04 so I will have to fly back again\nwhenever possible next year to get it renewed.\n- Go ahead with the renewal assuming that they will not ask about the STEM OPT.

Again, I will be submitting the I-765 with Premium Processing as soon as I land in\nReddit Posts\nthe US\nI am trying my best to submit the I-765 before I leave which would solve everything but I am still waiting on my company\nto fill out the form.\nDoes anyone have any advice on pros/cons with each option?

    " Questions Related To Being Laid Off While on a Holiday Outside of US\nBody of the post: Hi Reddit community,\nI'm currently on my first year of Optional Practical Training (OPT) as an F1 student in the U.S. and I have a situation that\nI'm hoping to get some insights on. Next month, I plan to visit India, but there's a lingering concern in my mind.\nThe possibility of getting laid off while I'm abroad is something I can't ignore. This brings me to two crucial questions:\n1. Re-entry to the U.S. if Laid Off: \nIf, unfortunately, I get laid off while in India, can I re-enter the U.S. without informing the Customs and Border Protection\n(CBP) about my employment status change? What are the implications of this?\nReddit Posts\n2. Unemployment Days Count: Another aspect that's unclear to me is about the count of unemployment days. Does the\n90-day unemployment limit under OPT start counting while I'm outside the U.S., or does it only apply when I'm physically\npresent in the States?\nI'm aware that maintaining legal F1 status is crucial and I don't want to inadvertently jeopardize it. Any advice,\nexperiences, or resources you could share would be immensely helpful. \nLooking forward to your responses and thanks in advance!\n": [
        "1. As long as you have remaining unemployment days, you are legally allowed to return to the US --\nthough CBP may give you extra scrutiny.\n2. Unemployment days absolutely do count regardless of whether you are inside or outside the US. In fact, CBP has\nsometimes assumed that OPT individuals who spent extended amounts of time abroad (90+ days) are not in fact\nemployed in the US, have run out of unemployment days, and refused them re-entry.\n- ",
        "I am not a legal expert, but I can offer some general guidance. It's crucial to consult with an\nimmigration attorney for advice tailored to your situation.\n1. **Re-entry after Layoff:**\n   - If you are laid off while abroad, you may face challenges re-entering the U.S. The CBP might question changes in\nyour employment status. It's typically advisable to have updated documentation supporting your status when returning.\n2. **Unemployment Days:**\nReddit Posts\n   - The 90-day unemployment limit usually starts counting when you are physically present in the U.S. Days spent\noutside the U.S. may not count towards this limit. However, maintaining continuous employment during OPT is essential.\nRemember, immigration policies can be complex and subject to change, so professional advice is essential.\n- ",
        ">1. Re-entry to the U.S. if Laid Off: If, unfortunately, I get laid off while in India, can I re-enter the U.S.\nwithout informing the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) about my employment status change? What are the\nimplications of this?\nSo long as you have valid documents (passport, visa, I-20, EAD Card) and have unemployment days left, you can enter.\nCBP may ask you questions about your employment.\n>2. Unemployment Days Count: Another aspect that's unclear to me is about the count of unemployment days.

As soon as that is not true,\nit starts running. Doesn't matter where you are.\n"

    " Re-entry on unexpired post-completion OPT after STEM OPT approved but withou\nBody of the post: Hey all. I have upcoming travel to Poland (Thu Dec 21 - Mon Jan 8), and I seem to be getting\nconflicting information about whether I need the new STEM OPT EAD card for re-entry even though my original,\npost-completion OPT EAD card will be valid when I re-enter. Right now, the application is pending but I anticipate it will\nget approved either right before or after my departure.\nEssentially, I'm worried about the following situation: I depart the US on Dec 21, STEM OPT gets approved and EAD\ncard gets mailed to my US address, I try to re-enter the US on Jan 8 and the CBP officer denies me entry because I\ndon't have the new STEM OPT EAD card, even though my original OPT card is valid until Jan 21. Is this something that\ncould happen? Would I even need the (not-yet-valid at the time of re-entry) STEM OPT EAD card to show to the CBP\nofficer on Jan 8, or am I worrying about this for no good reason because the fact that I have a valid original EAD card at\nReddit Posts\nthe time of re-entry is sufficient? My reasoning is that since I would be entering on a valid post-completion OPT, the\nstatus of STEM OPT is irrelevant because it would not yet be in effect at the time of re-entry.\nEDIT: I reached out to my company's immigration lawyers. They said I should be fine, since my current post-completion\nOPT card will still be valid at the time of entry. They said the only issue could be if USPS tries to deliver the EAD card\nbut no one is at home, which would result in them returning it to USCIS. This should not happen, however, as EAD\ncards are sent without delivery signature requirement, and if you live in an apartment complex, the card will be securely\ndelivered to your mailbox and waiting to be picked up by you whenever.\n": [

        "You can send in your I765 application online, your receipt will be generated immediately (provided you\nget your I20 today)\n- ",
        "If possible, call your DSO now and explain nicely if you don?t get this job it will cause severe economic\nhardship, and also your future to be ruined (which is true)\nAnd it?s true that with online application, theoretically you could apply even on the last day. But risky though\n- ",
        "Worst case scenario - I'd suggest to submit without i20 and with help of your DSO you can send your\ni20 in a day or two.\n"

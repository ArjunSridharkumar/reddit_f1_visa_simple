Figure out the\nReddit Posts\nmost effective way of presenting yourself to a potential employer as opposed to using a common resume across jobs. \nThe current environment is also particularly discriminatory towards recent college graduates. While it?s hard to, leverage\nwhat you have to gain experience in your domain. \nTry to take a longer term view (1 ? 2 year scale). \nI?m not sure of your particular circumstances, but, on an OPT you can work for free. Try to find a lab/professor/startup\nwhere you can be hired for minimum or no pay. This will save your unemployment days and hopefully add relevant work\nexperience. You also have STEM extension available after that, plan to get a job that allows you to apply for the\nextension \nI was in a similar situation and know plenty of people who graduated in May 2020, 2022, 2023 struggled to find a job and\nmanaged to land on their feet sooner than later.

        "It's totally okay to feel this stressed, because it is a stressful situation and not normal (like last 10 years\nat least). **I personally do not like statements like \"you are far better than people who are having worse time than you\",\nbecause it's bullshit to me.** I know many people can't walk and I can, so I should feel awesome, right? That's not how\nany of this works, its a pile of shit people tell others where they do not have anything nice or consoling to say to you.\nI would suggest you to **look at it objectively and work on the process, not the outcomes**. This is how I managed my\nsanity for now:\nReddit Posts\n1. Put in a fixed number of hours of efforts into job search (networking, applying) regularly. Do not go beyond that, the\nrest of the time is for your mental health.\n2. Find an activity outside that time that reduces your screen time (you don't want to be close to your email/job search\nportal), and do something that makes you forget about your stress. Workout, swimming, running, hiking, gaming, hobby\nprojects, diy crafting. Board games are helping me a ton in this case (can't workout due to long-covid).\n3. Make the process efficient and sustainable, do not think like I need to get a job by Feb/March, rather, put in consistent\neffort and think that all your effort is going to improve yourself only. If you are learning new things (codes/voluntary\nworks/social works), it's only for your self improvement.\n4. You can't control what the companies are doing. Meta has laid off thousands of people and their stock is roaring right\nnow, none of it makes any sense. Your actions of self-improvement will make you a better person, and when companies\ndecide again to hire new candidates, make sure you are a top one there.\n5. Do not mark that you need sponsorship because you do not. Others have already explained it.\n6. Do not go for continuous evaluation of your resume. Do a few iterations with ChatGPT, your friends and seniors\nworking at companies and stick to it. If you ask 10 different people, they will give you 10 different directions to change,\nbecause if you ask them, they feel like they have to give you some feedback and it start a loop of pointless A/B changes.\n7. Spend time with your friends, families (online) and hobby buddies. Keep yourself distracted and fresh for couple hours\ndaily.\nPlease remember always, this is a stressful time and it's okay to be stressed.

Just prepare hard and accept worse case and sleep happily.\nAs long as you do your best in trying and enjoy the journey, you will eventually settle in a job you will be pursuing.\nHealth is all that matters and learn to be happy as both are related. Trust me, things will work out.\nGood luck to you!!\n- ",

        "It?s not an advice nor do I recommend following this route but I, after applying for over a thousand\npositions back in 2015 and truly answering the sponsorship questions during the 11 months of my opt, decided to\nanswer no to those questions because why not, I had only one month of opt left and wasn?t ready to go back home\nempty handed. I, soon after, lucked out on a job offer that I quickly accepted. I had already lost my first chance at H1B\nbecause I didn?t have a job in my first year of opt and when I did get the job, I decided not to bring the sponsorship up\nbecause I had answered no to those questions. But sooner I became indispensable at my job and found the right\nopportunity to bring it up to my manager that I would need sponsorship to continue working but I didn?t share much\ndetails like it?s a lottery or this is my last chance etc. My manager didn?t even flinch and approved my H1B filing\nincluding responding to RFE and premium processing. It was my last shot at H1B but I wasn?t scared whatsoever\nbecause I was able to get tons of experience under my belt, recoup my loans and my company was ready to explore\nother avenues for me if I didn?t get selected in the lottery. But guess what, I got my H1B picked and approved and fast\nforward to today, I?m a GC holder and would be applying for my citizenship next year.

With your parents potential network, the growing job market, and\nincreasing opportunities, you could get an 8/10 gig there (whether as an employee or founder) versus a 5/10 role here.\n2. You realise there is inherent value to staying back and working at a particular type of company before you head back\nand do you what you want to do. In that case, I?ve helped a bunch of my friends land roles at companies and startups\nusing LinkedIn and networking. \nNot sure how you?ve been applying to companies, if it?s just online, but I?d suggest starting with the networking first\nand full sending that. Every morning wake up, go on LinkedIn search, look for data companies (or any other relevant\nindustry), set location to your dream locations, and start sending connection requests. Test between short notes, longer\nnotes, and no notes where you send a message after. Generally being transparent here and saying you like what they\ndo and you?re looking for a job is better. Try to get on a call learn more about the company, ask for relevant roles the\nteam is looking at, other companies if the one you?re talking to is not too relevant. You?ll start seeing a lot more\nopportunities. \nBut again, don?t just stay here for a 5/10 when you can go back to where you might feel better with a 8/10 job. \nDM me if you have any specific questions\nReddit Posts\n- ",

We were making mid seven figures a year.\nAt 25, my business partner threatened to sue me, I got sued by clients, my girlfriend who I was supposed to be engaged\nto left me, and I had a mental breakdown \nAt 26, I nearly went bankrupt, I owed the IRS money that I didn?t have because my partner wiped our accounts \nAt 27, one day, out of nowhere, my heart started to race at 210-240 bpm.

A lot of the job interviews are purely behavioral, with one\nor two technical cases at the maximum. So you get a lot of advantage if you can just improvise well during interviews.

        "While the post provides some insights, this is an oversimplification. Good grades account for some\nmerit in getting a job but that's not a priority. Don't spend too much time studying. \nPlease mind that my advise is more biased towards Comp Science majors.\nThe best way to leverage a Master's degree is to try to get an internship. Granted, finding one is quite difficult during\nthese times. But, if you manage to score one, you might be able to transfer that into a full time offer after you graduate.\nEven if it that doesn't happen, having an internship experience at a US company provides a substantial boost to your\nresume. The summer break is the best for this. Also check if your school offers co-op opportunities. And in many\noccasions you get a substantially better paycheck for the internship.\nReddit Posts\nAlso, network alot! For example, if you have an interest in Cybersecurity, join the club. Talk to the professors in a subject\nthat you're interested in and see if you can get in on a project. Or offer help. These experiences can really help you and\nalso build a good network of friends/professors that might be able to provide you with referrals.\nHaving a portfolio of projects helps a lot too (especially when applying for startups and smaller sized companies).\nLeverage hackathons and open source projects. \nAlthough I listed a few things, it'll be impossible to do all these things at the same time. So pick your flavor. Also, mixing\nthings up like this will really help you manage stress and stay consistent.\nI agree with OP on the fact that it's not very realistic to think that you could fund your whole education career with\npart-time work/in campus  work. However, the type of school you pick can make a big difference. Masters programs\ngenerally tend to be big money makers for schools. However, public research universities do tend to offer some tuition\nwaivers if you can score a teaching assistant position or a research assistant position. Instead of trying to get a loan for\n2 years (especially if it's high interest), I'd advise to get a loan for 1 year and see what you can leverage. Having said\nthat, not having the constant thought of figuring out funding will save you a lot of stress and help you stay focused.\nAnyways, wish y'all the best!\n- ",

        "Hello, I am a bit late to reply to you but I will anyway. \nI am also an international student in the US. I am currently finishing up my associates degree in a community college,\nand I will be transferring to a university in the fall. \nI was in the same position as you (also in my second semester). I felt like what I was doing was not worth it, and\neverything seemed boring and meaningless. My family and friends in my home country kept telling me to stay strong,\nand I ended up taking a break from social media because of that. \nReddit Posts\nI had one American friend only. We never hung out or anything like that though. I was extremely lonely. \nI overthink a lot, but in a good way. One night, I thought about how I could leave this mental state. I ended up giving my\nschool counselor a shot, and I loved it. I ended up seeing them once every week for an hour where I would vent about\neverything. Counseling is great, however, I only went there to vent, I expected no real advices, but my counselor was\ngreat and she ended up giving me some really good advices that I will share with you. \n1- Apply for a job at your college: The only way you can work while studying is through your college. There are advisors\nwho would help you in finding one. They were able to find a position for me, and I still work till today. The process took\nlike two months but it was so worth it. I work as a lab tech although I study Psychology but it is a super easy job. \n2-Distractions: Try distracting yourself. Develop a hobby, go on walks, take long showers (this really helped me the most\nto be honest?, work out, read, learn a new language, draw, etc?\n3-Take advantage of the free resources at your college: Join clubs in stuff that interests you. I joined a philosophy club\nand I met some people there. Also, make sure to visit your tutoring center. I ended up being a close friend with one of\nthe tutors. Try to ask if your college has Conversation Hours (it?s for ESL students but anyone can join), the purpose of\nit is to learn English but you can find some potential friends there. Also, make sure to check out your student email\nbecause they send various events that you could join. \n4- Speak up!: I am a pretty shy person and I rarely speak to strangers. But you have to remember that unfortunately as\nforeigners, people will mostly be shy to approach us because they don?t know what to say. I ended up having many\nfriends when I spoke with more students. Mainly try to keep it school related (I usually stay in class when the lecture\nends and ask students about some stuff related to the class). One guy was really happy that I talked to him and he\nReddit Posts\nended up asking me about my home country, he was extremely interested to talk to someone ?international.?\n5- Invest in your hobbies: Personally, I love movies, and I found out that AMC has a subscription for 22$ that enables\nyou to watch 12 movies a month. If you like working out, invest in a gym. If you like cooking, try to cook more, etc?.\nI hope that these advices will help you. \nAs for your questions. I do not think that you can take a gap semester although you can go to your country in the\nsummer! If you have an F1 stamp on your passport, then it is perfectly fine for you to go. You just need to talk to your\nDSO so they can sign your I-20 or something like that. I unfortunately can?t leave because I don?t have a stamp (I\nchanged my status in the US.)\nI promise you that it gets better. Just remember that this time is a huge investment for your future. Although I have some\nfriends here. I still feel homesick, and I tend to feel lonely some nights (which is why I started to sleep early, it helps!)\nFeel free to DM me if you wanna talk more about this.\nHave a good one.\n"

If anyone have any comments or information to add onto this or have\nany corrections please do! The more information the better! It will help others in the same situation.\n***Options you have***:\n* **Canada**:\n   * Use [this](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) link to calculate your Comprehensive Ranking\nSystem (CRS) score. If your score is above 540, then you can apply for Canadian PR and might actually have a chance\nat getting it within 6 months to a year I believe. I know the wait time for the PR might be longer than 3 months however\nyou can go back home while you wait for the PR. Once you get it you can move to Canada and look for jobs there.\n   * If your company has an office in Canada, you can ask for them to send you to their Canadian office. I'm not sure how\neasy it is to get a Canadian work visa but no matter how difficult it is to get it, it won't be on the same level as an H1B\nLOL. Once you go there you can apply for a PR as soon as you are eligible. Just do some research on it.\n      * If this ends up being an option, and if you get promoted to a manager position and work there for 2 years and then\ngo back to the US, I believe you qualify for the EB-1 C category of the employment based (EB) greencard category. You\nwill get your greencard very fast (unless you were born in India or China)\n   * If you get PR and eventually become a Canadian citizen, you can apply for a TN visa and then move to the US for\nwork. As far as I know, you can work in the US indefinitely on the TN visa. However, if you want to get a greencard, you\ncan't get one through the TN visa as there is no pathway to citizenship for this visa and you need to maintain\nnon-immigrant intent. If you want to get a greencard when you're on a TN visa then you have to apply for an H1B visa\nagain and go through the lottery or any dual-intent work visa. The only advantage in this option is that even if you don't\nget picked in the H1B lottery, you still have your TN visa so you can try again unlike when you're on a STEM OPT when\nyou have a limited amount of tries.\n* **O1 visa**:\n   * If you have the required qualifications and are eligible for this visa, you can apply for it at any time of the year and get\nReddit Posts\nthe visa. The eligibility criteria is very strict though so it's hard to get it but it doesn't hurt to check it out and try if you\nmeet the criteria.\n* **Marriage**:\n   * If you have a US citizen significant other, and both of you want to get married then this is your best option. You can\nget married and your significant other can apply for a greencard. You'll get it within a few months to a year and then after\n2.5 or 3 years you can become a citizen!\n* **Masters**:\n   * If you can afford a masters, you can get one and get another chance of employment and another 3 years of STEM\nOPT if you do a masters in an eligible major. This way you have another 3 years to try for an H1B\n* **Non-Profit (Cap-exempt H1B visa)**:\n   * This is an option I learned recently. I believe you are eligible for a cap-exempt H1B visa if you work for a non-profit\norganization like say an accredited university or college. You can bypass the lottery through this way and get the visa\nfaster.\n   * *Disadvantage*:\n      * When you switch to a job that is not cap-exempt, you're gonna have to switch to a regular H1B visa and go through\nthe lottery again. <-- this one I'm not fully sure about but that's what I heard.\n      * Fewer jobs available that qualify for cap-exempt H1B and probably even fewer willing to sponsor\n      * Salary is likely going to be lower\n   * Make sure you do more research for this option\n* **Worst Case Scenario**:\n   * The only option you have when everything fails is going back home.\n* Some people mentioned getting a greencard from outside the US. This is possible as far as I know. I don't fully know\nthe details so you're gonna have to do some research on your own for this. I do know however that this is impossible for\nIndians and Chinese so if you were born in one of those two countries just give up and go through the other options I\nmentioned. If those don't work then going back home is your best option.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

        "I feel you, I?m going thru the same since a few months. This is going to be a bit direct. Here are some\ntips I?d like to share with you: \n? reach out to your professors and ask for a volunteer position. Ask for a small teams meeting and discuss your\nsituation. Do this as soon as you can before your EAD start date. Usually takes time for HR to process internally.\n? do not spiral. Prioritize your health. Seriously, this is very important. Have a proper routine because this is going to\ntake a while and a system helps you keep stable. Do not overload yourself with too many applications in one day. Apply\nmax 20 jobs per day. Maximize on quality. Write that cover letter, attach the portfolio, certifications and publications.\nMake sure you actually qualify for the minimum job requirements - degree, years of experience and skills. \n? since you have gotten interviews already, you?re doing something right. Figure out what is that you did that landed\nyou interviews and do that more. If you wanna go extra, reach out to these recruiters and ask them what made your\nReddit Posts\napplication stand out to them, hopefully have a call too. \n? prioritize which job titles you want. Don?t waste your time applying to anything and everything. Don?t use LinkedIn\neasyApply feature unless it?s a position that you really like. This just gives you the illusion that you?ve applied to many\njobs but in fact they usually keep reposting. Apply directly thru company website. \n? have a professional from LinkedIn read and critique your resume. Ideally, this person has to be in a company and\nposition you?d like to be in. Ask for a call when they accept your request for resume review. Don?t use InMail feature.\nNobody responds, but definitely send personalized connections requests to people relevant to your field. A lot of people\nare willing to have a chat. One thing - try to make your resume ATS friendly, easy to read, but also unique. Have wider\nmargins, only relevant content and skills. \n? make a list of companies you actually want to work for. Have an easy access links to their careers website. Go to the\nH1B database website and see if they have sponsored visas in 2023-2024. If I come across a new company, I just\nGoogle ?company name + H1B? and quickly check thru the first 3 links. Check the company career page every week for\nnew positions. Don?t even bother with companies that don?t sponsor, whether you need sponsorship or not. It?s a\ndance you don?t have time for. \n? go to job fairs and network on LinkedIn. Job fairs - ask recruiters for business cards and send a LinkedIn request by\nend of day. For LinkedIn- try to connect with employees (not just recruiters) in the company and ask about company\nculture. Usually people are more responsive 2 pm onwards. Keep 3 special days in a week to connect with people on\nLinkedIn so you don?t overload yourself. The main focus here is to build rapport, have a chance to talk to employees of\nthe company and hopefully get a referral. \n? this may or may not work. Instead of matching keywords to job description using ChatGPT, I chose the job titles that I\nReddit Posts\nwant and made resume docx for each of them. This takes a little practice since you will need to read a few job\ndescriptions completely and get a feel for what types of wordings/skills these job titles usually require. Usually let?s say\nyou?re aiming for 6 job titles, then you 6 editable word files and 6 finalized resume PDFs. Have a website highlighter\nextension handy and add the missing keywords. If everything crucial is present, then use the uncustomized PDF. \n? more than anything, it?s about your mindset and belief. Of course the market is bad right now. But don?t lose faith,\nkeep telling yourself that you will find a job in the moments of doubt and keep pushing thru. This became much more\neasier for me once I started talking to people on LinkedIn.

        "Oh boy oh boy! I have quite the story for you. Almost the same story. But I have crossed the hump and\nam in a much more stable position now. \nI am from a third world country. Def had big dreams and effort to reward ration there was imbalanced. Hence I aimed for\nthe Greatest country in the world. Lol. The USA. \nI landed in the US after years of planning and preparation. The education was phenomenal. Lived in all the major cities,\nNYC, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, SF. I was loving my younger days and having full fun but then as a norm, I got into an\nage where I had to plan my life. That's when it hit me. US life is go fast, go hard, and balls to the walls approach. MY\ncousin is a US citizen and she had to take maternity leave and oh my god, that whole experience was so frustrating for\nher. The leave, being away from work, the disconnect with colleagues. She was a career driven woman but she also\nwanted to be a mom and oh boy, the company on paper accommodated her but in reality she was completely\noverlooked. For raise, for important decisions, bonuses. The same happens to men who take career gaps. If you are\nfortunate enough to work for a company who will retain you for 3 months you are gone, the company will more likely\nlearn to work around you and in the next layoffs your name might be on top. A lot of these are subjective offcourse, but\nReddit Posts\neveryone faces similar problems if not the same. Basically you will be punished if you are not going with the flow. \nI somehow got the mindset that money is everything while I was in US. I became laser focused on making money\nbecause my lifestyle was expensive. So the apparent choice was the middle east as I don't have any taxes. I didn't get\nlucky with the H1 lottery but I wasn't hurt. I anyway had this plan going on. \nNow I was making big bucks in Dubai and not paying any taxes. But again the same thing. Expensive lifestyle. I was not\nhappy with a decent car. I needed a luxury one. Higher spending. Save a decent chunk but not happy in general\nbecause here it was like you are on your own. No social safety net. No work life balance. Work work work. Married to\nwork basically. \nFinally I wanted to change this. I felt like I learnt more about myself and I wanted to be in a place where work is not\neverything. I wanted to develop simpler hobbies. I wanted to focus on my passions. Don't get me wrong. I am passionate\nabout my work. I love my work. But us and Dubai made me feel work is everything but this is bad! Any person should\nhave multiple passions and also keep exploring new things. Because if you have only 1 and it's not going well your days\nare depression and slow and you will not be that productive. (even the best employees have tough times now and then).\nIt's always good to have multiple things to rely on. Like gyming or hiking. A physical passion or hobbies is a boon on\ntimes of stressful work life. \nSo finally I moved to the EU. I know I might make it look easy or simple but trust me a lot of time has gone into planning,\nprepping. And a lot of reflecting and therapy sessions to really figure out the growth strategy for myself. \nThe EU has been great. People are generally smart. Cities are clean. Government work is quick. Alot of grunt work is\nsimplified. Food is so delicious and without chemicals. You get unlimited paid sick leave(up to 2 years in a single\ninstance so technically you could come back to work for a couple months and then take 2 more years off lol. But no one\nReddit Posts\nabuses this). My HR told me if I feel ill for as simple as mental fatigue, take a couple days off, I don't need to submit any\ndoctors letter). Basically EU is sustainable even after so many socialist policies is because people don't abuse benefits.\nThey don't have to. \nAgain, all of this might change in the next decade or so. But no one can predict it. USA can become the best country. Or\nsome 3rd world country is best place to be. For all I know I might move there. What matters to me is I am doing the best\nI can. I am doing things that matter to me. I am solving the problems I have instead of prolonging them. \nIf I am honest, not getting h1 should be a wake-up call to really look inward and figure out what you want from life.\nHaving h1 and getting paid bat shit crazy sometimes numbs you to your real self. \nAll the best buddy.\n- ",

If on top of that I\nwill have a kid (even one), my kid will have to be smart af and get a full ride or get a huge ass student loan.\nI definitely was looking into houses near bigger cities, however, my time in US showed me that I?m not a type of person\nReddit Posts\nwho can live in a suburbs with no nature, nothing to do and far away from everything, so if I stay in US I have to not only\nmove to a better state (better = more expensive) but also find a place closer to a big city which again means more and\nmore and more money. \nSo, I decided to look into jobs around the world as well. Obviously, in this case everything will depend on the country but\nI?m a bit more hopeful because while jobs in, for example, Europe will definitely bring less money, the cost of living is\nalso going to be lower. Getting a place in Europe (depends on the country of course) probably will take around 8-15\nyears. Additionally, the path to the RP and later citizenship seems to be slightly easier (still hard but). On top of that you\nget more PTO days, sick leaves, access to more countries and the jobs I was looking into would offer a help with\nrelocation. \nI guess I?m also more familiar with that region which makes me slightly more optimistic about it while I have never\nthought about living in Europe for real until this year.\nThose are things I?m keeping in mind when considering my next steps. I?m still not sure if I will leave or stay. I guess\nwe will see.\n- ",

Where do you intend to go?\nMe: In Los Angeles, particularly to study in Los Angeles City College (I wanted to give more details and start explaining\nwhy I wanna study there but I was afraid she?ll just cut me off and get annoyed like what my first interviewer did)\nVO: What do you plan on studying there?\nMe: I want to take a 2-year associate?s degree in business (Again, I want to explain more but I?m afraid of giving much\ndetails that she didn?t even ask for)\nVO: Who will be your sponsor?\nMe: My cousin who is a US citizen will be the one to finance my education. She works as a game producer at the Riot\nGames company where she earns a salary of $xxx,xxx and she agreed to sponsor me with her savings. She also\noffered me a stay in her apartment which is just a 30-min drive away from the school which is convenient for me. She?s\ngonna provide me everything that I need once I get there.\nVO: What?s the highest education you attained?\nMe: I took a 5-year bachelor?s degree in physical therapy and during those first two years I was consistently the top of\nour batch where I have received a full refund of my tuition as a reward. I finished my studies in June 2020 and I took the\nboard exam in Dec 2021 which I successfully passed so now I?m a licensed physiotherapist.\n(The 1st and 2nd VO literally asked me the exact same questions, and I didn?t even get the chance to explain why I\nwant to pursue business, what my post-graduation goals are, my ties to the country, etc etc.)\nReddit Posts\nVO: You know that you were denied previously right in your first interview right?\nMe: Yes ma?am\nVO: I?m sorry but I really can?t approve your visa *hands me the blue paper*\nMe: I?m aware I was denied the first time because I wasn?t able to properly answer a question, but now I wanna take\nthis chance to explain myself better if you would allow me.\nVO: Go ahead\nMe: The reason why I want to study business is because I really want to put a rehabilitation center in my hometown\nbecause there?s a need for it. There?s only a limited number of physical therapists back there because of less hiring\nopportunities and so due to the lack of job prospects, fewer physical therapists are choosing to work in my hometown.\nAs a result, physical therapy services are not really available in my community, so I really wanna do my best to fill that\ngap and pursue my passion while helping the people back in my hometown.\nVO: I understand your reason but I?m sorry. You can refer to the blue paper if you want to know why I can?t approve\nyour visa.\nI really don?t know what to do now. I want to apply again for a third interview but I?m afraid I?m just gonna waste money\nagain. What do you guys think where I went wrong?\n- ",

They\nalso wrote in the email: \"In addition to your CV\" without any mention of the detailed research plan that was in the paper\nshe gave me.\nGiven that, I have two questions...\n1. Do you think I should send them both a CV and a detailed research plan (along the form), or only a CV since that was\nthe only thing mentioned in the email, which is a more professional forms of communication?\nReddit Posts\n2. Regarding the CV, is it like a normal CV that we use to apply for universities or should it be different somehow?\nI'd really appreciate your help. Thank you ^^\n- ",

        "Hi everyone! Yesterday I went for my visa interview at the consulate in Belfast NI for F1 status as I am\nstarting a PhD programme in august. The interview went well and they didn?t ask me too many questions apart from\nwhat I was going to study, why I chose the university I am attending and my research interests. The VO explained I was\napproved for the visa and I was made to pay an issuance fee before leaving so I thought it was pretty certain I was\ngetting the visa.

        "PhD VISA RENEWAL STALLED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING\nBackground: \nI?m a 4th year PhD student in the US. My visa was initially issued for some reason for 4 years even though I was in a 5\nyear program. However, back then even though it was right after the whole covid frenzy, the visa process was seamless.\nI went to the embassy took all papers, they approved me on the spot and I had the passport back 5 days later. I\nassumed this time would be the same alas?On July 24 2024, my F1 visa will expire. I had two conferences to attend to\nin Europe and since I was leaving the country I needed to renew the visa. Went through the process and booked an\nappointment for July 12 2024 at the US embassy back home, (EU country where I got it the first time). Once at the\nReddit Posts\nembassy, the process went just fine, like the first time, I was told my visa was approved and that I needed to go pay the\ncashier, but the officer told me I needed to come back and see her after because she needed to explain something.\nOnce I went back, another lady who seemed to be the supervisor was there as well and they proceed to tell me that\nwhile my visa is approved, the system returned a yellow color or code don?t remember how she phrased it. But in short,\nshe said my application was subject to further processing and that this was not going to be done by them, but rather\nback in Washington. As such, she didn?t know why I got ?flagged? or any potential reason as to why this happened,\nbecause it?s not something generated by the consular office. She said ?they use an AI system and it used phone\nnumbers?. They weren?t making any sense, they were both talking over one another and honestly they were trying to\nnot freak me out (which i appreciate) so I never thought to ask who?s ?they?. Anyway, they tell me that it usually takes a\nfew days but can take up to a month to clear, that they will hold my passport and as soon as it clears, they will print the\nvisa and send it asap. I explained that my return ticket to the US is on August 20 so what happens if I don?t have it by\nthen ? And she said when I?m nearing that date, I should send the consular office an email (assuming I haven?t heard\nback) and they will inquire on my behalf with ?Washington?. But nothing more to do now other than go home and wait\nuntil I hear back from them.\nI?m like WTF just happened ? Did this ever happened to anyone ? I?m in my last year of PhD, about to graduate, I\ncan?t have delays like this. What could possibly be back in ?Washington? as she mentioned so many times that needs\nto check my visa application? Especially for something related to my phone number ? I?m not into anything sketchy, I\nonly got a speed ticket once in 4 years which I paid, I do nothing illegal, file my taxes, have an excellent credit etc.\nI?m white, european, and I mention this because she said it happens more for some countries and some names than\nothers.

And they were in touch ...\n- ",
        "A few things that I will tell you having gone through it successfully. \n1. Where you went to school does matter. It matters especially if you are moving to a major city, which you likely want to\ndo given there are more career opportunities. This is because given sponsorship can be expensive, employers have to\nview you as an asset to consider going through the process. They are much more likely to do this if you graduated from\na top program in your field than a mid-tier school. A lot of people won't like this but it's true. I've seen it with myself and\nothers. \n2. Speaking English very well as well as other useful languages can give you an edge in certain career fields such as\neducation, research, academia, law and sometimes financial careers, though less so. \n3. Having work experience helps a lot, but the most useful thing is to NETWORK. This is where how high your school\nranks comes into play. Having access to that network is key for internationals because you don't have as many\nReddit Posts\nconnections in the US as your American peers. I cannot tell you how much I networked. It was how I secured my current\nand several other positions. \n4. Have a skill or something to offer that stands out or that is uncommon in Americans: ie translation experience,\nlanguage skills, specializations in highly uncommon but necessary fields, etc. A lot of Americans only speak English,\nhave not lived or interned abroad and may have less experience working with diverse populations. A lot of internationals\nhave these things already by virtue of being international. Look and apply for jobs that require these skills and prioritize\nthese things. You will have an easier time. \n5. This one helps A LOT. But only apply to companies or organizations that have a track record of sponsoring or who\nhave current or previous staff that is international. They will be nicer and much more open and empathetic about this\nduring the interview process about your situation. Similarly, try to look for international alumni from your school and see\nwhere they work, then network with them. This is very helpful.\n- ",

        "Unfortunately you've graduated at a time when there have been a lot of layoffs in the last 2 years in all\nindustries but especially in tech where the majority of the sponsorship happen.

My SEVIS was\nterminated in November 2019 due to an unauthorized reduction in courseload, and I drove to Canada and re-entered\nthrough there. \nHowever, it?s not as easy as it seems. I was detained for hours at the border (trying to re-enter the US) and almost\ndeported because the CBP officer didn?t even fully know the correct laws regarding this process. That experience still\nremains one of the most traumatic memories of my life, and I?m pretty sure the only reason I was let back in is because\nI was traveling with my US Citizen partner at the time, and he was there with me while I was detained. Be prepared with\nevery document, every detail, and do this process as soon as you can. I was out of status from November 2019 to\nReddit Posts\nFebruary 2020 (because it took a while for me to get a Canadian tourist visa), and I don?t advise anyone to wait longer\nthan that.

Just try your best to explain your situation, I remember crying and pleading with her because I was panicking\nand couldn?t find a specific email that she wanted to see (regarding my administrative medical withdrawal which turned\nout to not be authorized by my ISSS). I ended up finding the email, but regardless of it, she finally gave me an i-94 after\nhours of questioning me, with a sentence I?ll never forget: ?If we give you an inch, don?t take a mile.? She had earlier\nthreatened to cancel my visa and deport me immediately. \nGood luck with your situation. I know firsthand how miserable it feels.

        "I had a very long academic career (some due to uncontrollable factors such as recession, some due to\nmy own procrastination) spanning from 2007 through 2016. I did my masters (non-CS) worked for a year using my OPT,\ncouldn?t get a job in an e-verified company to extend my OPT for two more years, so went ahead and pursued Ph.D.\nstudies which I finally finished in 2016 and got on OPT again for the second time with a higher degree and used it for\nthree more years before getting on H1B. \nAnyway, based on my experience, U.S. is a land of opportunities with definitely lesser competition compared to\ncountries such as India or China with huge populations. Especially, more so, in STEM fields where there is a definite\nlack of available local workforce. Majority of American citizens don?t even attend college, especially in STEM fields, as\nthey deem it expensive and tougher to finish. This is where the immigrant intake has helped sustain the U.S. in spite that\nlack of local STEM workforce. That is why you see a lot of immigrants in STEM fields. There are definitely ample\nReddit Posts\nopportunities for CS majors if you develop the right skillset and good communication skills. Securing an internship will\ndefinitely help secure a full time job eventually. People like to work with people who they LIKE rather than who has more\nskilled. Human decisions are largely emotional rather than rational! If you get into a good school (say top-50 in U.S.\nNews list), job fairs happen every semester where the FAANG and many Silicon Valley companies are regularly in\nattendance. Now the next decade would be AI adoption by many of these companies, so improve your ML and AI\nknowledge by taking relevant classes. \nOne advice I will give is to get an assistantship whether it is during Masters or Ph.D., that way you?re not mounting any\neducation debt and will also get paid for your part-time work as a graduate assistant along with health insurance\ncoverage. I never amounted any debt all through my nine years of academic journey and always had an assistantship\nwhich paid for my living expenses as well. So essentially, even if I left US in 2016, I would have been debt-free. \nIf you don?t believe me, just believe the data. There are about 4.9 million people of Indian-origin who are U.S. citizens\nwhether they immigrated or natural-born citizens to Indian-origin parents. Additionally, there are about 2.7 million Indian\npeople who are currently on green-cards and other various types of visas.

        "Work restrictions - every other grad student in my program has secret second and third jobs because\nour stipends aren't even close to a living wage. International students are risking deportation, not just a slap on the wrist\nfrom the university.\nNo access to loans - my student health insurance has to be paid in a lump sum at the start of the fall semester (and I\ndon't get paid in the summer). The university's advice is to get a loan. I obviously can't, as an international student.

        "I wish F-1 visa can be renewed within the US\n- ",
        "Regardless of cultural background or country of origin, there are difficulties the overwhelming majority\nof international students face. From my experience I'll list a few:\n \nReddit Posts\n- Work authorization:\n         This in my opinion is by far the biggest challenge F1 students face. Work authorization under F1 is aggressively\nrestricted and any violation, even unintentionally could result in immediate termination. In addition to the regural\ndifficulties just about everyone encounters in the job market, international students have extra difficulties due to the\nlimited nature of work authorization under F1. So many international students end up missing out on wonderful job\nopportunities they're qualified for simply based on their status. It can be frustrating for most international student\nbecause this is a factor out of their control. \n- Tuition Fees and cost of living:\n       A few international students are blessed enough to get fully funded scholarships or assistanships or even out of\nstate tuition waivers which helps alleviate the financial cost of their educational journey. However this isn't the case for\nmost international students who in many cases have to pay out of state tuition fees regardless of how long they've been\nin the US and are not eligible for 99% of student loan programs within the US. Some international students have found\nthemselves in situations where they've had to drop out of school for financial reasons and dropping out of school as an\ninternational student almost always means termination and potentially deportation. Due to financial hardship, many\ninternational students end up risking jeopardizing their visa status by getting a job where they get paid under the table.\n- Visa renewal:\n       In some cases, for some international students, a visit outside of the US could be a deadly mistake. There is never\na guarantee you will be able return on your student visa in the event your visa stamp is expired and you need to renew.\nA denial  of your visa is always a possibility and hence, some international students come to the US and never go back\nhome even to visit because their visa stamp has expired and they fear it will not be renewed.\nIn my opinion, so many rules surrounding the student visa need reform. I understand studying in the US is a privilege not\na right. However international students deserve better considering how much they contribute. The US has at least 24\nReddit Posts\nBillion-dollar companies that were founded by international students. Even Elon musk was once an international student.\n- ",

        "This is BS of the highest quality. They are either trying to get you at a cheaper rate, and/ or they might\nleave you high and dry when it is time to sponsor your H1B. For all purposes, as long as you are legally allowed to work\nin the US good employers don't usually distinguish between someone on their H1B vs F1 vs Green Card. Yes, some\ncompanies take issues with F1 because only a small category of F1 students are eligible for STEM OPT extensions, but\nin those cases where you get 1 year of Post Completion OPT, most good employers try to enter you in to the H1B lottery\nReddit Posts\npool and proceed from there. If you are eligible for STEM OPT then employers are even more relaxed because they get\nyou for at least 3 years, but you have to be careful that the employer is e-verified otherwise you cannot work with them\non your STEM OPT.\nThe only cost that I can see here is that they do not intend to sponsor your H1B (application for which is about USD 10)\nand petition IF your picked in the lottery ($700 but contingent to you getting picked), and since you might not be eligible\nfor a OPT extension/ they are not e-verified they might lose you after your current OPT expires. All in all, try to dump\nthem. You do not want flaky employers especially given how precarious H1B and F1 situations are right now.\nAs far as negotiating your salary is concerned, all I am going to say applies only if you are a good candidate.\nCompanies/ teams typically have an approved budget range for every position. I resort to classic haggling - I start out\nwith an ask that I know has a high probability of being rejected. I then work my way from there and stick to a lower\nbound for myself (see below note how I calculate a basic lower bound). This fails in some cases sure, but try to stick to\nyour narrative. I have had decent success with this and I continue to do so. But foremost, you need to abandon your fear\nof them being upset. Getting hired is a transaction, which many people fail to realize. They need you as much as you\nneed them. Yes they pay you, but you work for them and drive their revenue. So, forget about upsetting someone and\nfocus on getting what you want, because that is what they will focus on too. \n**For how do I set my salary lower bound**\nDetermine their pay range:  They cannot offer you below the approved amounts because otherwise there are\nrepercussions to unused and approved budget (essentially they will never get that money again and they cannot lure\nbetter people with better pay). Based on the number of years of experience, work expected, hours, commute, expenses,\nand any other things which you think are related to your job, I try to come up with a monthly figure which I have to\nspend. Factor in even the tiniest expenses, even something like food (it adds up).\nReddit Posts\nLook at their pay, and see how much will you end up saving. If everything that you have to spend is more than 40% of\nyour NET salary (post tax), negotiate for higher pay. You can of course choose to be greedy and have that spend\npercentage around 25% of your post tax salary, but this is where you have to play with them to see how willing are they\nto give you what you are asking for.\nE.g. if the pay range is 75-120k per year (based on the number of years of experience of a candidate they hire), that\ngives you a monthly gross pay of 6250 to 10000 per month pre tax. Here is where you need to do a bit of math because\nyou will need to calculate how much you pay in federal and state taxes (for this amount somewhere between 18% - 33%\neffective tax rate). This gives you about 5000 - 8000 per month post tax (I have not factored in health insurance which in\nmost cases is deducted from your pre-tax income). Don't spend more than some percentage acceptable to you, and\nthen work your way from there trying to maximize the amount you have left in your bank account at the end of it.\nThis of course is not financial advise in any form, and neither am I the best planner. Take all of this with a grain of salt. If\nanyone has better ideas, feel free to write them below - would be nice to see other plans and incorporate some of those!\n- ",

I got sent an email the next Monday (1 working day later) saying that my\npassport is on its way back to me, received it on Tuesday with a slip asking me to arrange an interview.\nI then got an expedited interview scheduled within a week - the whole process at the Embassy took 3 hrs but the\ninterview itself was less than a minute and very much routine. I got my passport back within 48 hours. This was in\nLondon.\nAs I was going through the process I was freaking out because there was a chance that I would miss my flight (and I\nwas scared about the refusal) - but you can't really explain / understand why a refusal happens. I still have no idea why I\nwas handed a refusal initially. They do process F1s crazy quickly so all you can do is hope for the best. It all worked out\nfor me in the end!\n"

As\nopposed to schools that do this as a cash grab for students buying time for H1B or other applications.\n>Question is why does USCIS not plug this loophole by not allowing Day 1 CPT?\nBecause as shown above, Day 1 CPT can have legitimate purposes for academics. And USCIS does not oversee this.\nSEVP does. And SEVP is already reviewing this and the outcome will be horrific for any students involved when it\ncomes down.

As stated before USCIS does not in any way shape or form oversee this. SEVP does.\n2. Because most schools are not for profit entities and care about the quality of their students and also do not want to\nrisk their SEVP accreditations for a short term gain...

        "Keeping immigration laws aside.\nLook at Day 1 CPT colleges.

Submit your details, a random plagiarized statement of purpose and\nyou get in.\nTake any leagues like Big10, Big12, SEC etc. they have a much higher bar for getting in and it?s not that easy. Their\nacceptance rate would be around like 20/30% or even lower, where as these no name schools have almost 90%\nacceptance rates.\nExample: If UCLA becomes a ?Day 1 CPT? school, the demographic of people attending, quality of education and\nstandards will drastically go down.

In order for CPT to be allowed at the start of the\nprogram, it has to be a genuine requirement (meaning ALL students in a particular class or program track are required to\nhave an internship).\nHU had a large percentage of students who did not work on CPT yet they claimed it was 'required' for purposes of\nallowing day 1 cpt.

Also, even\nfor PP, i took them 2 weeks (which they already say that a new clock starts for 30 days and they are supposed to give\nus the result) which being said, I got my approval today, 8th august.   lastly, you have to pay $1685 additionally on top of\nwhat you paid when you applied.   \nI got really tired and I waited almost 100 days before switching to PP because my employer changed my start date thrice\nfor me because they understand that ultimately, this is not our fault. \nI hope this helps!\nReddit Posts\n- ",

Here are some thoughts:\nReddit Posts\n1) Return for college (like you said you will) and DEFINITELY study a STEM related field (so quantitative econ, finance,\nmath-adjacent stuff MAY count, ask your DSO (designated school official). If you study STEM then your STEM opt\nallows you to stay 2 extra years after regular OPT (so 3 total years after college grad). This gives you 3 chances to apply\nfor H1B if you're proactive and hopefully you get it. Despite that your chances are 50/50.\nYes, H1B is brutal, some people have to pay out of pocket and it's a LOT of money. The problem is that companies are\nless incentivized to sponsor H1B recently because of the rising costs. It severely lowers your chances of getting a job\nand the market has been HORRIBLE. So good luck and I wish you the best. \n2) Find love. I wanted to go back to my home country after college, was completely prepared. But I got proposed to last\nmonth by my long time girlfriend (and tbh my bestest friend) and now I'm going to apply for my GC. So in my case it was\nunexpected and it helped me with immigration purposes. \nObviously as you said you don't want to count on this, but is this any more shaky and risky than your other options?\nAbsolutely not, immigration to the US is brutal and really hard.

SEVP will address the issues with the following initiatives:\n1. An hour-long maintenance outage on Thursday, April 18, 2024, from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nEDT. During this time the SEVP Portal will NOT be available. Any changes to Student and\nExchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) student records will upload to the SEVP Portal\nonce the portal is back online. SEVP will not send a follow-up email regarding system\nReddit Posts\navailability. This effort will address the following issues:\n? Designated school officials? (DSOs?) inability to generate temporary passwords for\nstudent portal password resets.\n? Students? inability to log in to the SEVP Portal.\nNOTE: Like the March outage, when students log in to the SEVP Portal for the first time after\nthe system update, they will need to change their password. There will be a notification on the\nSEVP Portal Sign In page explaining the outage and password reset requirement for students.\n2. A rolling, backend SEVIS Portal data resynchronization effort that should not impact portal users.\nStudents should see correct information in their portal accounts by Monday, April 29, 2024. This\neffort will address the following issues:\n? SEVP Portal inability to authenticate users.\n? The portal displaying a generic ?error? message when students try to update their portal account information.\n? The portal sending erroneous missed portal validation and reporting emails.\n? Employer information missing from certain portal records.\n? When DSOs update student email addresses in SEVIS, the portal is not accepting the newemails addresses and is not\nsending updated email address emails to students.\nReddit Posts\nUntil these two initiatives are complete, please do not contact SEVP or the SEVP Response Center (SRC) about the\nissues listed.\n- ",
        " i had one separate question concerning SEVP so would appreciate the community's help.

Or do i still report it as the end date\non my current ead card and change it after my stem opt extension gets approved? i see the stem opt application has a\nquestion on \"start date of stem opt extension\", which directions from schools mention to fill out as the first date after your\ncurrent opt expires if continuing with the same employer. i know we may not have the answers, but would be curious to\nhear anyone's thoughts\n- ",

        "Hello everyone! \nSo I am trying to file my taxes on Spritntax for the last year.  \nA little background before getting into it: \nMy F1 5-year visa expired on Nov '22. My first day in the US as an F1 visa student was in 2018. I've been in and out to\ngo back home for vacations an started working on OPT since June '22. I've been in the United States since the last the\ntime I entered (August 21') and never left.\nNow a couple of things is happening on Sprintax:\n1- On the \"Residency Status\" page, I am forced to to enter a \"leave date\" for the last row, even though I never left the\nStates since my last entry. The website instructs that the F1 visa expiry date shall be entered if the person is still in the\nReddit Posts\nUSA. \n2- In \"State Taxes\" section and particularly \"Living in the US\" page, it's forcing me to say that I was outside the States\nfrom the date my visa expired till the last day of the year. This is definitely inaccurate. I contacted the live chat and an\nagent explained to me that this should be fine if I entered all my information correctly. \nHowever, this is still not making sense to me and I just don't want to file my taxes incorrectly. So I was wondering if\nanyone else is facing the same issue. I am being kinda extra careful with this because I am afraid that this might affect\nthe results of my substantial presence test on the website and whether or not I should be getting my FICA taxes back. \nAnother weird thing is, I entered my info on TurboTax just to comapre. The state tax refund matches on both website.\nHowever, Sprintax says I owe some federal taxes and **I am getting my FICA taxes refunded** , while TurboTax says I\nam getting a federal tax refund **excluding**  the FICA taxes. \n&#x200B;\nI am getting getting so confused about this and any input will be super helpful!\n- ",

Depending on what you owe/are owed, you\nmay have to pay a penalty. After you have done that, I would say try not to worry about it - that's really and truly all you\ncan do.

        "So this question has two sides and let me explain them. I say this as a DSO and someone who has\nhad to decline applicants over visa items. \nThis question let's us know if you need visa sponsorship. Many if not most positions in the United States will not qualify\nfor visa sponsorship. Meaning that the position is not technical enough or does not pay enough to meet requirements for\nan H1B visa. That with few exceptions is the visa a company would need to sponsor you for to work in the US. \nSo asking this question does 2 things. It let's an employer know if you may need to sponsored and it helps them select\nthe appropriate candidate. For example, most jobs in my office do not qualify for H1B. Therefore anyone who indicates\nthey need sponsorship won't be considered because we CANNOT offer sponsorship in any way shape or form. It is\nimpossible for the positions to meet the requirements for visa sponsorship. \nAnother way to think about the questiob is this: what is your time worth? You go work for a company on OPT/STEM\nOPT only for the position to not be eligible for H1B or possibly the company is not large enough to pay for all the\nrequirements for H1B or for another reason cannot meet H1B requirements. You essentially wasted your OPT time with\nthat company with no longer term options for you. \nReddit Posts\nThose are the two sides, it let's a company who otherwise cannot sponsor you know that they can't select you as it\nbenefits no one in the long term and it allows you to get offer with a company who knows that you will need sponsorship\nin the future and is potentially willing to do that. \nTo the poster who said it is discriminatory, it is not as employers can ask questions about your legal employment status\nin the US and it was settled over a decade ago in the courts. \nIf you lie on your job application a company can fire you for cause. Meaning you can lose access to benefits (like vested\nshares in a company, Healthcare benefits after being fired, and no access to unemployment).  The only time to answer\nno is it you honestly have no plans to stay in the US. \nWill selecting yes prevent you from being selected for jobs? Yes.

Other people end up doing it because it is\njust what your family wants you to do, or because it's what society expects you to do. They are lazy, they are mediocre,\nthey are spoiled. Nevertheless, they make it exactly as anybody else. If they do it, why can't you do it? I think that getting\na PhD to have the chance to live in a country that you love is a more than valid reason. In my very personal experience,\nwhen speaking about research, there is very little to romanticize. It is a 100% a business, and PhD students are just\nturds sitting on the lower step of the chicken coop ladder. If you decide to go for a PhD, it will be hard, you will probably\nhate it (or part of it), but you will probably make it, and that will make things much easier immigration wise. Still not easy,\nbut much easier.\nI don't know your exact situation, but I am wondering if you are over-constraining yourself in your job hunt.

        "Copying my response from 5 days ago when this same question was posted here:\nYour DSO is just advising conservatively. \nIt's important to remember that F-1 status is a non-immigrant status. As a non-immigrant, you are never guaranteed\nentry into the US. This means every time you choose to travel outside the US, there is always some risk you will not be\nallowed to re-enter.\nChoosing to travel then becomes a matter of risk assessment and risk management. It is then not a yes or no answer\nyour DSO can always give you. Your DSO is advising cautiously related to those risks. \nThe list of items you mention you plan to have is the same as what the US government provides you should have to\nrequest to re-enter the US once your classes have ended and your OPT has been approved. Have your EAD and your\njob offer available to show if asked for if requesting to re-enter the US once your study has ended and your OPT is\napproved.\nThere are times when risk to re-entry is lower and times when it is higher. In the middle of your degree returning to\ncontinue study with a valid I-20, travel signature, and valid F-1 visa is a lower level risk. Traveling when you need to get\na new F-1 visa before coming back is something that increases risk. Traveling once you've finished study, your OPT is\napproved, but you have no job offer is much higher risk. Traveling with a pending OPT application after study has ended\nis a little higher risk. \nReddit and even a DSO can never guarantee you trouble free re-entry. People can get denied for some rather\nunexpected and random reasons. Be careful about what you have on your phone/electronics. There are stories of\nReddit Posts\nstudents getting denied entry because of information CBP found on their phones as part of secondary inspection.\nInstances of them finding evidence of unauthorized employment, drug use, or academic dishonesty are all things that\nhave caused a small number of those requesting F-1 entry to be denied. These are all things that a DSO advising you is\nalmost certainly not going to be aware of. \nBe aware of the requirements (which it sounds as though you are). Decide what level of risk upon re-entry request you\nare comfortable with related to how much you really want to travel. Make your decisions.\n- ",

        "Taxes are filed on income in the US.  \nFederally Income Tax and State Income Tax.  \nSocial Security Tax and Medicare Tax may also be removed- depending on if you have been an f1 student on opt/stem\nin \nthe \nUS \nfor \nover \n5 \nyears- \ni.e. \nnow \na \n?resident \nalien? \nfor \ntax \npurposes \n(See-\nhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes)  \n**Tax Withholding vs Tax Returns:**  \nTax Withholding is the amount held back from my paycheck and paid to the IRS on my behalf. This amount withheld is\nbased on a W4 form you will fill and give your employer when you first start working each year. That said, why do I need\nto still file my taxes?  \nBecause if the amount withheld was too much or too little based on what the IRS will properly re-calculate when you\nactually file your taxes with them (and based on other things that may have come up in the year that were not put into\nyour W4 at the time you filled it like loans, or a mortgage, etc), you will be able to get a refund on the overdrawn amount\nof tax that was deducted from your income, if these are deductible items that reduce your tax bracket or to get\nnotification of what you still owe in taxes to the IRS.  \n(P.S. This means that if you are self-employed and living in the US, you don?t exactly have an ?employer? above you\nwho is paying you a taxed income. Meaning if you don?t file your taxes and make those withholding selections at the\nstart of each new year on your own or pay your taxes monthly or quarterly with methods I have zero knowledge on right\nnow, you and your business are owing the IRS taxes and it?s how people get into tax issues/tax fraud not stating their\nReddit Posts\ntaxes correctly)  \n3 out of 4 taxpayers receive tax refund after filing their tax return form. And even if you may not get a refund, it is illegal\nnot to report your taxes and if you ignore it, just know that they will be sitting there waiting for you, accruing for each year\nyou are in the US, with monthly fine penalties for each month that passes after the filing deadline period- April of each\nyear but usually still possible till about October. So you should always file a tax return for the past year (e.g. 2021)\nduring the tax filing period usually Jan to Apr of each new year (e.g. 2022), even if your employer has withheld and paid\ntaxes from your income for you.  \n**Forms:**  \nWhat is W4 (Employees Withholding Certificate)- You as an employee are the one who fills this form, letting your\nemployer know based on your responses (responses on? if single or married, if multiple jobs or not...) if some\ndeductions should exist or not), and therefore how much tax should be withheld and sent to the IRS from your income.  \nWhat is W2 or 1099 (Wage and Tax Statement)- A W-2 tax Statement shows important information about the income\nyou have earned from your employer through the year, the amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck, benefits\nprovided and other information for the year. You use this form to file your federal and state taxes. YOU GET THIS\nFROM YOUR EMPLOYER BEFORE THE TAX FILING PERIOD BEGINS IN EARYL JAN OR FEB. If you don?t have an\nemployer, but need to file taxes where do you get it from? Or is there no need for it? I guess the IRS sends you this at\nthe end of you personally filing your own taxes, for the start of each tax return period each year.  \n**Tax Deductions:**  \nA tax deduction lowers your taxable income and thus reduces your tax responsibility. You subtract the amount of the tax\ndeduction from your income, making your taxable income lower. The lower your taxable income, the lower your tax\nbracket and so the lower your tax bill, meaning you will get some money back in tax returns, if these deductibles come\nup through out the year after you had already filled your W2 form and given it to your employer to make a general tax\nwithholding on your behalf to the IR.  \n**What are tax deductions (write offs) that can help you get tax refunds when you file your taxes in the filing Jan to Apr\nperiod?**  \nReddit Posts\nStandard deductions ensure that all taxpayers have at least some income that is not subject to federal income tax.\nStandard deductions generally increase each year due to inflation. You have the option of claiming the standard\ndeduction or itemizing your deductions. However, you can never claim both in the same year. You will find that many\nstates that impose an income tax will also allow you to claim a similar type of deduction on your state income tax return. \nBecause you can only use either standard deduction or itemized deduction on your taxes, to lower your taxable income,\nthe IRS recommends that you take the time to run the numbers to see which option gives you a bigger deduction\notherwise you might actually be losing yourself some money by deducting less, having a higher taxable income, and\npaying \nmore \nin \ntaxes \nas \na \nresult. \n(See:\nhttps://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-deductions-and-credits/what-are-standard-tax-deductions/L7oiVM1DH)  \n**Things that can go towards an Itemised Deduction (If you choose to do this, instead of the calculated flat standard\ndeduction that the IRS provides for):**  \n\u00b7 Interest paid on your mortgage  \n\u00b7 State income taxes can be deducted.

        "I don't see this as being changed anytime as the proclamation was sort of a nothing proclaimation.\nWhen it came out we were worried, but after the details were announced, no one was really worried anymore. Like many\nTrump policies, it was a lot of flash and show and big words, but in actuality it didn't do muchm\nThere are 300-400,000 Chinese students in the US. Of those, this policy would impact between 2-5,000 of them based\non the best estimated numbers. So around one percent of the total Chinese student population is expected to be\nimpacted. That said, more than likely these students were already being denied under other State Department policies\non visa issuance. \nReddit Posts\nThis Proclamation was mostly political posturing for Trump in the U.S. during an election year. Even before this\nproclamation there was already an internal policy on restricting Chinese students (and other non-allied countries like\nRussia, Iran, Turkey, etc.) with military and intelligence connections. \nPolicies like this have been in place for several decades (Cold War) and Trump did not really add anything other than\nmake a previous internal policy more public to show he was \"strong on China\".\nThe actual impact to Chinese students as a whole should be more/less unnoticeable. Obviously for those who are\ndenied it is pretty impactful, but we shouldn't really see a difference in approval numbers. \n[If \nyou \nare \ncurious \nyou \ncan \nsee \nour \nprofessional \ngroups \nevaluation \nof \nthe\nproclamation.](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-resea\nrchers-connected-prc) \nAs this is a National Security item and has been of concern to the US intelligence community there is no Political Win for\nBiden to reverse this policy or really address it as the actual impact is tiny or even insignificant if many of the impacted\nstudents were already being denied visas. \nI can also tell you, China has a similar policy of restricting visas to current/former foreign military or intelligence\nemployees.  Most countries have similar policies for non-allied or non-friendly countries. \nTrump just made a show of making it more public to gain more foreign policy credibility during an election year. \nIf you are concerned due to the lack of visa issuance at Embassy/Consulates in China, this policy has nothing to do with\nthat. The embassy closures are due to COVID-19, limited staff after the evacuation flights, and on going staffing\nReddit Posts\nlimitations. We expect that May/June as embassy staff return to China that visa processing will begin again. This is\nmostly around vaccine availability and retraining/training staff returning to the embassies. There was a lot of turn over\nand it takes time to get embassy and consular staff trained as well as to get the embassy fully up and running again after\na closure. \nSo, with that context, I hope it helps alleviate some of your concerns on this topic and also why it has not come up as a\nhigher policy agenda. \nBy all means continue to advocate because having the discussion is NEVER a bad thing, but also don't expect any\nimmediate responses to the proclamation. There is no real political win there outside of removing a talking point from\npublishing houses wanting to gain views.\nEdit:Typos\n- ",
        "As noted, this would impact a very small number of Chinese students. It does not apply to\nundergraduate students at all. Undergraduate students are those studying for an Associate or Bachelor's degree, and\nthat's the majority of Chinese students studying in the United States. It impacts only some graduate level study for only a\nsmall percentage of those applying for an F-1 visa for graduate level study. \nEveryone should have the right to petition governments, and you should absolutely use freedom of speech to speak out\nagainst government policies with which you disagree. If you disagree, it is your right to speak out for and petition for\nchange. I fully support that right for everyone. \nOP: \"...could cause almost all the new incoming Chinese International Students? F1 visa rejected.\"\nFactually, this Trump act would not any any way result in \"almost all\" Chinese students being denied F-1 visas as the\nReddit Posts\nOP claimed in this post. 1% is not 99%. It may not be helpful to try to scare students into thinking their visa will be\ndenied for something that wouldn't even be a consideration for the vast majority of F-1 visa applications. \nSo speak out. Petition. Gather and protest. But don't scare Chinese students who would not be denied a visa based on\nthis to think they might be denied.\n"

        "First, no anonymous sources. They mean nothing. I also see no chatter about this in my DSO Circles\nor my F-1 immigration law circles. \nHere is my understanding of the situation as I have seen this roll out over the last few months of posts here:\nThis isn't a new interpretation. This is a crackdown. \nThis is essentially a crackdown on DSOs who haven't documented majors correctly via CIP codes registered at their\nschool.\nA University has to report each and every degree it offers including the concentrations to the Department of Education,\nReddit Posts\nalong with the relevant CIP code.\nThe verification that a degree matches the STEM CIP Codes is overseen by the schools Educational Accredit\norganization.\nSome schools are not ensuring their STEM OPT degrees are in fact listed and registered as STEM OPT CIP Codes with\nthe Department of Education.\nThere have been a few posts about this here in the last few weeks. Each time so far, it was because the degree was not\nactually registered as a CIP Code with the Department of Education.\nMy school has had a few denials in the past 2-3 because the degree name did not match the CIP Code. It took a quick\nletter from the Department explaining that CIP Code naming conventions are different than degree naming conventions,\nvalidating the STEM CIP, paperoekring showing it was registered as STEM CIP, and a letter from our accreditation\nagency, and the application was approved\n>For example, an MBA is not a ?major?\nCorrect. It is a degree. An MBA is a Master's Degree with a focus on Business. \n>even if the track/concentration for your MBA is Management Sciences, it will be denied under this new interpretation.\nIt should not be. The concentration would be the major in this case.\nReddit Posts\nEx: Master in Business Administration - Management Sciences.\nNow if the school only registered a single CIP code to the MBA (52.0201 Business Administration) , and didn't have\nseperate breakdowns of the degree for Managment Sciences (52.1301) then this could be a problem. If, to use the\nundergraduate terms; the school treats the concentrations as minors not as majors... That a problem.\nSimple example:\nAnthropology (45.0201) is not a STEM degree... But Archeology(45.0301) is a STEM eligible degree. \nIf you get a PhD in Anthropology at a school, it could be in Cultural Anthropology (45.0204 non-stem eligible) or\nLinguistic Anthropology (30.4701 or 16.0102 or 45.0201 non-stem eligible \n) or Archeology (45.0301 STEM eligible) or even Medical/BioAnthropology (45.0203 non-stem eligible). \nHowever, the Department may only awards a single PhD in Anthropology (45.0201 non-stem eligible) to every focus. \nIn which case, the Archeology student... Despite having on the surface a STEM eligible degree... Got screwed.\nThis could be the case for this MBA issue. \nAt my University are working on a business degree to get it certified as a STEM CIP degree because it isn't currently.\nOnce it is, we can issue STEM OPT for that program, which is great!\nSo, I see no other chatter about this in other non-public groups. I have seen similar questions come up since October.\nSo far they have been related to CIP Code issues.\nReddit Posts\n>Those who have a graduate degree that is not explicitly a ?science? or ?STEM? in title, are now at risk of being denied\nIF and only IF their application was pending at/after August. \nNot a legal or even possible way to determine a STEM degree. See my example with Anthropology above.\n>For example, an MBA is not a ?major? but even if the track/concentration for your MBA is Management Sciences, it will\nbe denied under this new interpretation.\nSee my Anthropology example again. Almost certainly a documentation issue on the school's side.\n>They only want science ?majors?, despite most grad degrees not having a major as it is an undergraduate concept.\nBottom line: Be careful if you only have a STEM concentration. \nThis concept exists at the Graduate level. See my Anthropology example. You can get:\nPhD Anthropology - Cultural.  \nPhD Anthropology - Linguistics    \nPhD Anthropology - Medical/Biological    \nPhD Anthropology - Archeology\nOr just PhD Anthropology.\nAll the above are possible. But it depends on how your school's does their paperwork. A smart MBA program converts\nthe entire MBA to one CIP code  Managment Sciences (52.1301).\nReddit Posts\nHowever there are disadvantages to breaking up a single degree into multiple CIP Codes and many schools don't do it.\nHope this helps.\n"

Your SEVIS record where F-1 updates are made and reported by your DSO (and by you\nif on OPT and using the SEVP Portal) is not with USCIS.\nReddit Posts\nYour SEVIS record and OPT reporting is all done to and through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).\nSEVP is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), not part of USCIS. SEVP controls SEVIS, not USCIS.\nTherefore, your reporting requirements, and missed reporting requirements, are with and through ICE and not USCIS. \nThe only interaction with USCIS related to OPT is the OPT application as only USCIS can issue an EAD. However, that\nOPT authorization, the reporting, and rules of OPT and F-1 status being enforced is done by ICE, not USCIS. \nThat's also why the OPT reporting portal is called the SEVP Portal (and not the \"USCIS\" Portal). \nThe only way USCIS would be looking at this information is if you submit a new application (or your employer does) for a\nnew immigration benefit or status (such as H-1B). If in that process USCIS makes the determination that you've ever\nbeen in violation of status, they can deny you that new benefit or status for the application with them. \nYour 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month OPT reporting requirements with SEVP/ICE is something you either\ndo or you don't. It's not something you can fix or ask someone else to fix for you if you miss that responsibility. It's not\nyour DSO's responsibility to remind you of your responsibility. Your DSO can't fix it for you if you don't do it on time.\nSEVP puts a link in your SEVIS record within the reporting window that a DSO clicks to confirm your reporting when you\nreport to the DSO. Once the reporting window closes, SEVP/ICE removes the link. And that's it. Reporting opportunity\nhas closed. \nWhat happens then? That's up to ICE (and USCIS if you ever submit any new type of application to them). So far,\nhonestly, I've never seen anything happen. Does that mean ICE/USCIS will never care about it? Nope.

Unfortunately, this means you NEED to have an approved OPT\napplication along with a valid EAD card in your hand when entering the United States (very high chances of them asking\nabout the same during CBP inspection). Without these approvals, you're basically showing intent to end your program\nand hence your stay in the US as a student.\nSecondly, post approval of the OPT application, it takes approximately 2 weeks for the card to reach your mailing\naddress.

A single alcohol related arrest or conviction within the last **five** years;\n2. Two or more alcohol related arrests or convictions within the last **ten years**; or\n3. If there is any other evidence to suggest an alcohol problem.\nThe cable and subsequent FAM guidance provide that to establish ineligibility under INA Section 212(a)(1)(A)(iii), the\npanel physician's finding must include:\n1. Diagnosis of mental disorder (alcohol abuse); *and*\n2. There is evidence of current or past harmful behavior associated with the mental disorder that has posed or is likely to\npose a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others in the future.\nIndividuals who need advice regarding the impact of a DUI on visa eligibility or maintenance of nonimmigrant status\nshould be referred to an experienced attorney.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

I still took the risk\nsince I had to meet my family whatsoever. \nSurprisingly I got the visa approved in 5 days, and stamped for a full 5 years even though I had only about 2.5 years at\nmax for OPT.

        "Let me explain what happened because there is a lot misunderstanding in this thread.\nSchools have 30 days from the start of the academic term to register students. If we cannot do that, a students record\nwill automatically be terminated.\nOne of the things we must do is enter a students address into SEVIS. Without an address registration isn't possible.\nBased on the given dates, it looks like this in fact was part of the issue. The address given was not acceptable for\nSEVIS. OP then took over a month to correct the issue. By then it was beyond the 30 day reporting deadline.\nSo the issue from the school was poor communication, but otherwise it was due to slow response of OP to get a valid\naddress submitted. Again, better communication could have prevented this, but it is an obligation that OP had to fulfill.\nGoing to the question at hand, it is almost always better to travel and reenter. If not, you cannot leave until the I-539 is\nadjudicated. That can be 12-18 months currently AND if denied then OP could have more significant consequences.\nThe only time I advice I-539 is when a student has an expired visa or is from a country with difficulties in travel (Iran for\nexample).\nReddit Posts\nAnswering your question about how was this overlooked by the University and how are you liable?\nYour immigration status is YOUR immigration status. Technically a DSO designation is supporting the government and\nthe school. Not the student. It is about maintaining immigration regulations. If a student fails to maintain those\nregulations it is the students responsibility not the schools. Functionally schools are much more supportive because l,\nwhy would we not? So often a International student coordinator/advisor/counselor is also a DSO. This gives them\ninstitutional obligations to support students, but it does not create immigration requirements to support students.\nSo, there could be a request from the school for finacial support for the I-539 payment or supporting travel due to their\nlack of follow up, alerts, acknowledgement, warnings, etc. But that would only be based on institutional policy and would\nnot be impacted by immigration regulations.\nAlso, OP I wouldn't call a submission August 31 and then another October 2nd \"update documents ona regular basis\". If\nyou submitted additional times and only had Sucess on the 2nd then it would be different, but your description sounds\nlike two attempts.\nFyi: Your schools International Student office has a, \"how are we doing survey\". You can submit a complaint there. You\ncan also submit your complaint to the director of the office and your university Ombudsman. Request financial support\nfor travel and reentry (ex:school pays the new SEVIS fee) or pays the I-539 fee.\nEvery school eventually makes a mistake. We typically have one at this level every 18 months. With thousands of\nstudents it will eventually happen even with good planning. What seperates schools is their response to these errors.\nWe have a budget to help correct these types of errors. We cannot pay for travel, but will generally cover administrative\nfees.\nReddit Posts\nHope this helps with background, context, and some ideas going forward.\nEdit: Spelling\n- ",

Firstly you have to get I-983 plan ready with all the details of the company (you may have\nto reach out to HR or immigration team at your company), then ask your manager to write the training plan as part of the\ni983.

Then you apply for STEM\nOPT. These days it?s taking 3 or more than 3 months to get STEM OPT. You can keep working even without the EAD\ncard on your hand. But as I said you have many things to plan even before you officially apply. Atleast get your i983\nready. I think once you get your i20, you have to apply in 3-4 weeks for STEM OPT, otherwise it gets rejected. So if you\nwant to wait, maybe you can get your i93 done and wait for lottery results.

In one it seems to indicate you were doing full-time work part of the time,\nand in the other you state you've been working part time the entire internship. So which is it? \nReddit Posts\nBeing authorized for CPT doesn't actually require you to do the CPT. It is authorization that *allows* you to do practical\ntraining. For F-1 status purpose, it doesn't then obligate or require you to do that practical training. If you are authorized\nfor full-time CPT and then only work part-time, that's not an F-1 status violation. It just means you didn't work full-time. \nThat's for F-1 status purposes. Of course, if you're required to do a full-time internship to earn your degree and you don't\ndo that, that's an academic matter. \nIt would be a violation if you were only authorized for part-time CPT and then worked full-time.

        "It happens. The most common reasons I think are:\n- missed time window. There?s the 30-60-90 rule, that you have to apply within 30 days of your DSO endorsing your\nI-20, no later than 60 days after your program has ended and no earlier than 90 days before. I?d say the leading cause\nof OPT denials is people not upholding one of those 3. \n- DSO error. DSO are only people too and unfortunately, they sometimes make mistakes. Not often but I?ve heard about\ncases when someone?s DSO issued a new I-20 but forgot to change the date in SEVP portal, resulting in the application\nbeing delivered past the 30 day window.\n- using an outdated version of the form. Always use the form from the USCIS website.\n- Missing signature or some other info: I think that they?ve recently allowed people to resubmit while maintaining original\nfiling date but still, missing signature on either I-765 or I-20 will be grounds for denial\n- wrong fee - this one was quite specific for last year. USCIS was planning to raise the fees but some court in California\nblocked it, resulting in some people sending the wrong fee. Again, check the USCIS website right before submitting \n- problems with the payment - either the check bounced or they were not able to get money from the credit card.\nPersonally, I was using cashier?s check both for my initial OPT and STEM extension to make sure the payment goes\nthrough.\nThis is by no means an exhausting list but I think those are the main ones.\n- ",
        "It's rare and usually for a technical reason like a problem with the application fee. If someone applies\noutside of the eligible application dates that will get a denial. Submitting the application without first getting the OPT\nrecommendation in SEVIS/OPT I-20 from the DSO will result in denial. Occasionally someone who wasn't technically\nReddit Posts\neligible to apply will get through and get denied. Examples would include someone who already had a previous OPT at\nthe same or higher degree level or someone who didn't meet the full academic year requirement.\nApplying online now should, in theory, end application rejection due to application fee issues as the application is only\nsuccessfully submitted if the online fee payment goes through.\n- ",

        "During my undergrad, I did two co-ops accumulating 350 days (356 according to USCIS) of CPT. I was\nunder the 365 days limit regardless. But unbeknownst to me, my DSO never updated the correct employment dates on\nSEVIS after my completion of each co-op so my application went in showing that I worked for 384 days which is\ncompletely untrue. This is despite the fact that after each completion, I came back to my school and got my I20 travel\nsignature from the same DSO to travel back home. The fist clenching fact is that she had 4 years to enter the first set of\ndates and 2 for the other to the time I was applying for my OPT. I had a job in hand before graduation and had timely\napplied for my OPT. I was also in talks with another firm for a better opportunity which I was hopeful about. I still\nremember that day...10th August, 2019. After 134 day, I checked my phone that morning to get a case update and it\nsaid that my intitial OPT was denied. Devastated is an understatement to describe how I felt at that moment. I work my\nbutt off during undergrad, extending my graduation by 2 years by doing 2 co-ops so that no employer can ignore me for\nlack of experience, only to be in the situation that I was in. After notifying the HR of the Nebraska DOT (who I had the\njob offer with before graduation) about the denial, they revoked my offer since they had already waited for almost 2\nmonths for me to start. Within 12 hours, I also got a rejection from the other firm I was hopeful about. I walked to my\nschool with a heavy heart asking them for any help they could provide. Another senior epmployee at the Internation\nStudent Office went through my I765 form and could immediately see the reason for denial. Luckily, I had a week left to\nreapply which was time left upto the 60 day mark after graduation. I mailed my application again on that day itself with\nReddit Posts\nthe correct dates along with former employers' letter saying the same for additional proof because a motion to re-open\nthe case was more expensive and time consuming. Craziest part was that I actually got a call from an USCIS agent\n(which I first thought was a scam lol) on around the 40th day mark after my second time applying, asking me why I have\napplied again when it was rejected the first time? He joking said that you can keep applying...we like your\nmoney...WOW! I explained the whole situation to him and pointed out the proof of employment dates from my co-op\nemployer. When he gave me a verbal approval, I was more than relieved. Rightaway, I got my case approved the very\nnext day on the portal.

This info I got on telegram itself. I couldn't get all the documents before first opening and\nsecond opening was my only shot. The supposed slots would be for interviews starting July 15. \nAnxiety got me checking telegram right from 13 th June. I would monitor it every 10 mins, into the night. When they\ndidn't announce on 15th, the anxiety just kept growing. But finally they did around 23-24th. Although when it opened, it\nlooked like it was only a lucky couple of spots. But later it opened freely and people were happily swapping slots almost\n3-4 days into the opening. This means there was enough slots and time for everyone. \nDon't listen to the agents trying to sell you those services. They have the same website but just more resources. You\ncan easily get it even if you monitor 1-2 times a day.\nReddit Posts\n- ",

However, if you feel that your academic workload is\ntoo heavy or you want to focus entirely on your studies, it?s perfectly fine to prioritize that.\n3. **Scholarships or Funding Requirements**: If you have any scholarships or funding that requires you to work a certain\nnumber of hours (e.g., a research assistantship), not fulfilling those requirements could affect your funding.\n4. **Networking Opportunities**: Part-time jobs, especially on-campus, can be good for networking with professors, staff,\nand other students. If you decide not to work, you might miss out on some of these opportunities, but you can still\nnetwork in other ways.\nUltimately, the decision to work or not should align with your academic goals, financial needs, and personal well-being.\n"

        "OP, based on your post and relies; it seems you are interested in the F1->GC path.\nHere?s my knowledge based on hearing experiences from other people.\nWhen you apply for a GC, you apply under a category. Most GCs are *sponsored*, which means that\nsomeone/something has to back you up in the process. When people marry a U.S. citizen, their partner is the sponsor\n(usually) and this counts as family sponsored visa. \nNow, a lot of people get sponsored a GC through an employer. A lot of employers don?t sponsor directly F1->GC, they\ntend to use an intermediary visa category. Options of intermediary visa categories are H1B and L1B. Each of them have\ntheir processes of obtaining them. You might wonder, why do they need the intermediary step? \nMany employer sponsored GC categories like EB2 and EB3, have a more than 3 year timeline. If you are a F1 student,\nthe maximum number of years you can have working for an employer is 3 years. For some employers, this timeline\nmakes them uncomfortable because it is really likely you will not finish the process before you have to leave the US. \nAnother argument is that as soon as your employer starts the GC process, you are showing immigrant intent. If you\ndon?t finish the GC timeline, you will have to leave the US or apply for another US visa and having a GC application\nstarted while you were an F1 student, does not look good in the eyes of immigration. Remember, a F1 visa a\nnonimmigrant visa. As a result, it is preferred to be in a dual-intent visa category, like H1B to start the application\nprocess.\nNow, as I said, H1B is one of those intermediary visa categories. How do you get an H1B visa? Well, your employer\nReddit Posts\nputs your name in an application pool. In theory, there are 2 pools: the postgraduate pool (P1) and the rest (P2). During\nthe lottery, 20K applications get selected from P1. Applications from P1 not selected, get combined with P2 and 65K\napplications get selected. In total, every year, regardless of number of applications, 85K H1B spots are available.\nEach year, the chances of getting your application selected depends on how many applicants have applied that year.\nThe number of applicants have increased every year, and it is not expected to decrease. Each year the probability is\ndifferent, and you can approximate it by doing 85K/# of valid applications. You can go and Google how many\napplications/applicants were each year. It used to be roughy 25% chance. Some years (I believe 2021 & 2022), it\ndropped to something like 12%. Now, with some math of probability, you can calculate the expected value of getting\nyour application selected at least once in N attempts to be N*P, where P is the probability. STEM students get 3-4\nattempts.\nAll of this to say, there?s no guarantees. Yes, the probability of getting a GC after F1 through an employed is non 0%.\nBut it is not 100%. It always falls something in between. It is up to you to decide whether or not that risk/chance is\nsomething you want to attempt and make life decisions based on.\n"

If\nyou're coming back and your opt is still pending, you may be able to enter (but customs has the right to deny your entry\nif they want to). \nCons of traveling: Nobody knows exactly when USCIS will get to your case. if your opt gets rejected while you're abroad,\nyou cannot come back to the US on the same F-1 visa. (You can on a B1/B2 visa, but you can't work), and so you lose\nthe OPT opportunity for this Masters degree. Or if your opt gets approved while you're abroad, you will need the EAD\ncard to re-enter the US, which means someone has to get the package and mail it to you to home country or by some\nother means. This means more time and money wasted on international mailing. Package might get lost. Or if you're\napproved but your EAD card has errors on them, like wrong birthday or name or photo or start date (it happens), you will\nhave to get USCIS to send you a new one.\nPros of staying in the US: if your opt gets rejected, you get to apply again and won't risk not being able to come back.  \nCons of staying in the US: you can't work while it's pending.\n  \nFor reference, I also had the same thought a few months ago.
